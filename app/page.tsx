<b>Elden Ring Map: Limgrave Region starting point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=457&lat=-195.257812&lng=100.316924&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Limgrave Region starting point</a>. Limgrave has a lot of places to visit, but only a few of them are essential. Right next to the First Step Site of Grace you'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Mask+Varre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Mask Varre</a>. Exhaust his dialogue for some info about the world and to start his quest. Your first step will be to head to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Elleh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of Elleh</a> and meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Merchant+Kale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merchant Kale</a>, one of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Merchants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Merchants</a> of the game. Patrolling between the starting point and the church is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tree Sentinel</a> boss. He will be extremely difficult at this stage of the game, so it is <strong>strongly</strong> suggested to avoid him until you unlock your horse and become stronger. Defeating him rewards you with his <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Halberd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Halberd</a>. At the church, buy the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crafting+Kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting Kit</a> Kale offers, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torch</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Telescope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telescope</a>. Also make note of the nearby upgrade bench. You can do optional cave and catacomb objectives to gain talismans and materials as needed.<br /><br />
<b>Gatefront Ruins:</b> Head over to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gatefront+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatefront Ruins</a> and obtain the Limgrave West map fragment for the area. Also pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Whetstone+Knife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whetstone Knife</a> so you can use <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skills</a> in your weapon and get <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Storm+Stomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Storm Stomp</a> from an underground chest.<br /><br />
<b>Unlocking Torrent:</b> Visit 3 sites of grace, or rest in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=403&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatefront Site of Grace</a> to speak with Melina and unlock <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent+(Spirit+Steed)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrent (Spirit Steed)</a>, your mount. After this, <strong>teleport</strong> to the Church of Elleh Site of Grace to meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Renna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renna</a> and unlock the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Calling+Bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirit Calling Bell</a> and get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lone+Wolf+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lone Wolf Ashes</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Boc the Seamster:</b> South-east from Gatefront Ruins (past east of the telescope on the map), you'll hear a shout belonging to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Boc+the+Seamster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boc the Seamster</a>. He's been transformed into a small red tree, so hit the small tree once and talk to him to begin his questline (see <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Side+Quests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Side Quests</a> for other quests). This quest will take you to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Coastal+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coastal Cave</a> (southern portion of the western beach), which also unlocks access to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Dragon+Communion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of Dragon Communion</a> (if you continue further in the cave without exiting it via portal). Defeat the demi-humans in the Coastal Cave, then go back to Boc at the entrance to return his <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sewing+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sewing Needle</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tailoring+Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailoring Tools</a>. South-east from Boc's first location, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Cavalry</a> will spawn during night right on the bridge. Defeating him awards the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Repeating+Thrust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Repeating Thrust</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Sorceress Sellen:</b> If you are a mage or intend to learn sorceries, you will want to unlock <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceress+Sellen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorceress Sellen</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Waypoint+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waypoint Ruins</a> - follow the road south from Gatefront Ruins to find it. She's past the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mad+Pumpkin+Head" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mad Pumpkin Head</a> Boss fight.<br /><br />
<b>Stormhill:</b> Head towards <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormhill</a> (past the Gatefront grace leading west) and talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roderika" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roderika</a> to begin her quest and receive the Sitting Sideways gesture, alongside the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Jellyfish+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirit Jellyfish Ashes</a>. If you want to further Roderika's quest in its entirety, make sure to retrieve the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Chrysalids'+Memento" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrysalids' Memento</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormveil+Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormveil Castle</a> later. You will pick up a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> just before arriving at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhill+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormhill Shack</a>. There's also a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a> here that you will want to start collecting.<br /><br />
<b>Warmaster's Shack:</b> Follow the road East from the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhill+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormhill Shack</a> in Stormhill and you'll come to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Warmaster's+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warmaster's Shack</a>, where you can purchase Ashes of War from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knight+Bernahl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knight Bernahl</a>. At night, Bernahl will be gone, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearing+Hunter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bell Bearing Hunter</a> boss will spawn as you enter the shack. Note that this boss may be extremely challenging at this point in the game. Defeating him awards the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bone+Peddler's+Bell+Bearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bone Peddler's Bell Bearing</a>. Similar to ashes hunter badges in previous games, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bell Bearings</a> unlock new items in the game's primary shop when given to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twin+Maiden+Husks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twin Maiden Husks</a> after you arrive at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roundtable Hold</a>. Just south from here in the hills where the trolls are, you can visit at night and be invaded by a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathbird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathbird</a> mini-boss and get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blue-Feathered+Branchsword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue-Feathered Branchsword</a> talisman.<br /><br />
<b>Alexander (Potboy):</b> Continue northeast along the road from Warmaster's Shack and turn right as you see a bridge and hear someone shouting. There is a small path to take up the cliff to your right-hand side. You will meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander (Potboy)</a> and can free him to begin his quest and earn the Triumphant Delight gesture and 1x <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Exalted+Flesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exalted Flesh</a>. You have to hit him with a heavy attack or several times from behind.<br /><br />
<b>Deathtouched Catacombs:</b> Before we proceed, there's another dungeon nearby with useful loot, especially if you're going for an assassin type class. Return a bit west, to the barricades you passed through where you just fought the dog and commoners. Leave the barricades and head east along the road towards the bridge again. This time stick to the left of the road. Before the bridge, follow the path next to the cliff and you will find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathtouched+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathtouched Catacombs</a>. Inside there will be gathering/farm materials, upgrade materials, an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Uchigatana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uchigatana</a>, the talisman <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Assassin's+Crimson+Dagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assassin's Crimson Dagger</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a>.<br /><br />
<b>D, Hunter of the Dead:</b> Further down the road, past the bridge, you can meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/D,+Hunter+of+the+Dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D, Hunter of the Dead</a>, and begin his quest (if you already reached the Roundtable Hold before this point, he will not show up since you would have first met him at the hold instead of near past the bridge, but quest progression remains the same).<br /><br />
<b>Murkwater Cave:</b> You will now want to return to the lower area of Limgrave, to go up the ravine from Agheel Lake until you find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Murkwater+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Murkwater Cave</a> that has a special surprise, and then <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Murkwater+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Murkwater Catacombs</a>. You will get invaded here, so be careful! If you wait a bit to defeat the invader, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloody+Finger+Hunter+Yura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloody Finger Hunter Yura</a> will show up to help you defeat him. You can meet him back north of Murkwater Cave afterwards, where you can exhaust his dialogue to start his quest.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: East Limgrave Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=775&lat=-185.07031&lng=116.60938&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: East Limgrave Starting Point</a>. East Limgrave doesn't have a lot of objectives, but the Rune Bears in the area are more than a challenge, so you should avoid them at all costs. Your plan for this area should be to loot and leave, as it's likely that you are underleveled for it.<br /><br />
<b>Kenneth Haight:</b> First you will head to some broken structures along the northern cliff of the area (easiest place to start would be at the Artist's Shack grace or follow the road North from the Gatefront Ruins after passing the bridge). A group of demi-humans must be dispatched, then you can talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Kenneth+Haight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Haight</a> atop the ruins, and agree to serve him. He asks you to liberate his keep to the south.<br /><br />
<b>Third Church of Marika:</b> Continue following the road northeast from here until you reach the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Third+Church+of+Marika" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third Church of Marika</a>, where you can loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flask+of+Wondrous+Physick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask of Wondrous Physick</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Crystal Tear</a>. This is an important flask for your journey so don't miss it!<br /><br />
<b>Map Fragment & Siofra River Well:</b> Follow the road south until you find the area's map fragment. Beware of Rune Bears, but just by the map fragment you'll also find an altar with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greenspill+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenspill Crystal Tear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiked+Cracked+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiked Cracked Tear</a>. There's also a Teardrop Scarab nearby that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Ground+Slam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Ground Slam</a>. Once you have looted the above, go inside the structure. Take the lift down all the way to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siofra River</a>, activate the Site of Grace down there, and head back up - you will come here later as it's very above your current level.<br /><br />
<b>Blaidd in Mistwood Ruins:</b> Nearby is the Mistwood Ruins, there is a howling wolf that you will hear. Once you hear him you can go back to the Church of Elleh location and talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Merchant+Kale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merchant Kalé</a> who will give you a gesture. Do the gesture (<strong>Finger Snap</strong>) to the wolf and he will jump down, and you can talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blaidd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blaidd</a> and start his quest.<br /><br />
<b>Fort Haight:</b> Continue south from here, you can take a detour to meet the Nomadic Merchant of the area if you wish. To the very south, you will encounter <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fort+Haight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fort Haight</a>. There's a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> to be picked up before you go in. Then kill all the enemies within and loot the tower on the right side from the entrance to obtain the very important key item: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dectus+Medallion+(Left)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dectus Medallion (Left)</a>. There's also <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Warrior's+Cookbook+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (6)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Bloody+Slash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Bloody Slash</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Return to Kenneth Haight:</b> Now that the fort is free, report back to Kenneth in the northern area. He will reward you with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdsteel+Dagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdsteel Dagger</a> and offer you the opportunity to enter into his service, choice is up to you. You'll next find him back at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fort+Haight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fort Haight</a>, where you fought the knight that dropped the Ash of War.<br /><br />
<b>Summonwater Village:</b> Once this is done, head to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Summonwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summonwater</a> (northwest from the Third Church of Marika), where you will face a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tibia+Mariner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibia Mariner</a> boss. Defeat it to gain your second <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Skeletal+Militiaman+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeletal Militiamen Ashes</a>, which will enable a discussion with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/D,+Hunter+of+the+Dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D, Hunter of the Dead</a> at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roundtable Hold</a> (you may also find him instead near the Summonwater Village Outskirts grace west of here if you didn't reach the Hold yet). In a chest in an underground area, you will find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Green+Turtle+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Turtle Talisman</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Accessing Roundtable Hold:</b> Afterwards, go back to the Third Church of Marika. In the back there will be a portal that will take you to your next location. Open the door and rest at the site of grace. Melina will offer to take you to the Roundtable Hold (which again, if you have not already reached yet earlier from resting at enough graces, since activating them alone isn't enough).<br /><br />
<ul><li>If you have access to the Roundtable Hold, after that discussion a gateway will be marked on your map that allows you to teleport to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Sanctum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bestial Sanctum</a> in eastern <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caelid</a>. You don't need to do this now so don't worry about it if you haven't been to Roundtable Hold!</li></ul>

You can summon players or use <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirit Ashes</a> to help with the fight. Using Torrent is suggested. The Dragon Heart you obtain can be traded for <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantations</a> at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Dragon+Communion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of Dragon Communion</a> accessed by traversing through <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Coastal+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coastal Cave</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Royal House Scroll:</b> If you are a sorcerer, you will want to obtain the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Royal+House+Scroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal House Scroll</a>, that you can bring to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceress+Sellen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorceress Sellen</a> to unlock more inventory at her shop. Head southeast from the Agheel Lake South site of grace, toward the top of a cliff and you'll see a statue of an object that looks like the half piece of a bowl or a circle. Face the other way, to see a Knight. Keep going to a structure to see a man standing watching over the big structure, alongside a dead body. In that body, you will find the Royal House Scroll.<br /><br />
<b>Blaidd's Quest in the Forlorn Hound Evergaol:</b> To continue <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blaidd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blaidd</a>'s quest, head to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forlorn+Hound+Evergaol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forlorn Hound Evergaol</a> and summon Blaidd for the fight against <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound+Knight+Darriwil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodhound Knight Darriwil</a>.

<b>Weeping Peninsula & Irina's Quest:</b> Proceed south into the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Weeping+Peninsula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weeping Peninsula</a> and you'll meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Irina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irina</a> by the road.

A miniboss roams the area at night. This is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Cavalry</a> and defeating him will give you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Barricade+Shield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Barricade Shield</a>.<br /><br />

See the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oridys's+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oridys's Rise</a> page for details on where they are. After that, head north of the tower to find a site of grace, and a few enemies. Further after that, you'll find a corpse on a chair holding a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a>, and a statue which points to the nearby catacombs to complete.<br /><br />
<b>Mage Equipment in the Peninsula:</b> Southwest from the Bridge of Sacrifice grace, there is a Forest Lookout Tower which rewards a Hand Ballista. Directly south of here is a grace named South of the Lookout Tower. If you play as a mage, your next stop is <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Forest+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi-Human Forest Ruins</a> (following the path west from this grace), as their leader drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Queen's+Staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi-Human Queen's Staff</a> which is quite good at low levels (you could also fast travel to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia+Crystal+Tunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia Crystal Tunnel</a> grace you found earlier in Caelid, and find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Meteorite+Staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meteorite Staff</a> in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Swamp+of+Aeonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swamp of Aeonia</a> on a corpse in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Street+of+Sages+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street of Sages Ruins</a>).<br /><br />
<b>Tombsward & the Minor Erdtree:</b> From here you will head North to find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Faith-knot+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faith-knot Crystal Tear</a> guarded by some hostile plants. Directly west is a church containing a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Tear</a> for your flask. South from here leads to both the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tombsward+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tombsward Catacombs</a> and the Minor Erdtree, which contains both the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimsonburst+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimsonburst Crystal Tear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Opaline+Bubbletear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opaline Bubbletear</a> for your flask. Down the plains, you can see a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Walking+Mausoleum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walking Mausoleum</a>: these are used to replicate Remembrances, which are the "Boss Souls" of the main bosses of the game.<br /><br />
<b>Western Peninsula Points of Interest:</b> Several points of interest are also west of the Minor Erdtree, including another church holding another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Tear</a>, and the Isolated Merchant's Shack, which you can buy a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lantern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lantern</a> to avoid needing a torch for dark areas. Note that in the Witchbane Ruins north of the shack, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceress+Sellen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorceress Sellen</a> is there, but there is no way to interact with her for now. Keep the location in mind, though, because it will become important in the later stages of her quest.<br /><br />
<b>Castle Morne:</b> It's now time to take on <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Morne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castle Morne</a> south of where Night's Cavalry was. Note a golden seed right hand side on the path towards castle (which also leads to a map fragment of Weeping Peninsula). This is a simple souls-style dungeon, with a lot of verticality. Notable points are to not miss the drop to meet Irina's Father. From Take the lift to the castle proper and from the entrance go straight past a Pumpkin Head and to the right. Take the ladder, defeat nearby enemies and cross a bridge. With the bridge to your back look LEFT for some barrels. Break them to reveal a ladder and drop down below. Follow this path past some enemies and up a tower to meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Edgar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edgar</a>. Once you complete the boss of the area, return to Irina's father, and finally back to Irina to finish their quest. You can also go straight back to Irina without speaking to her father, in which case you skip out on some dialogue. <em>(Note that I would advise against completing this quest too soon until your weapon upgrade is at least +8, because you'll obtain a+8 weapon after progressing enough in this questline, which may affect your ability to interact with other players since matchmaking is affected by weapon level)</em>.<br /><br />

Go into Stormveil and defeat <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Margit+the+Fell+Omen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Margit the Fell Omen</a> at its gates to ensure you unlock a conversation with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Melina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melina</a> that takes you to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roundtable Hold</a>. Once here, you should talk to all NPCs and familiarize yourself with the many locked doors.<br /><br />
There are several NPC quests you can start and continue here in the Roundtable Hold:<br /><br />
<b>Roderika & Hewg:</b> You'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roderika" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roderika</a> here once you've given her the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Chrysalids'+Memento" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrysalids' Memento</a> (found in Stormveil) at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhill+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormhill Shack</a>, or have rested at any grace in Liurnia. She'll reward you with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> if you have given her the memento - if not, you'll find a Golden Seed back a Stormhill Shack where she used to sit. Once Roderika is in the hold (this will be after Stormveil if you are following this route exactly), go back and forth speaking to Roderika and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Master+Hewg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Master Hewg</a>, choosing options that try to convince Hewg into taking Roderika as his apprentice. After you've exhausted all their dialogue, reload the Roundtable Hold and Roderika will now become your Spirit Tuner and the two will have additional dialogue. Return to the place you found the Chrysalids' Memento and you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Hood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Hood</a> in it's place. (Note: If you hadn't found the Chrysalids' Memento prior, it will be completely replaced by the Crimson Hood. The Memento is only used to progress Roderika's quest if you hadn't aquired the Liurnia of the Lakes Site of Grace early.)<br /><br />
<b>D, Hunter of the Dead:</b> After defeating the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tibia+Mariner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibia Mariner</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Summonwater+Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summonwater Village</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/D+Hunter+of+the+Dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D</a> can be found and spoken to at the Roundtable Hold if you haven't already in Limgrave. He'll show you the way to find another NPC, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gurranq+Beast+Clergyman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gurranq, the Beast Clergyman</a>. Once you visit Gurranq, D will sell his wares to you.<br /><br />
Gurranq can be found at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Sanctum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bestial Sanctum</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caelid</a>. If you teleport there as soon as you're given the waygate location by D, you may be a bit too underleveled to defeat the enemies there. Head straight into the building and don't fight the gargoyle here until you're strong enough to. His quest involves giving him <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a>, and each time you give him one, you unlock a new item in his shop. After giving him the fourth Deathroot, an event triggers the next time you visit Gurranq. Damage your attacker until they've been pacified, but don't defeat them. Gurranq's quest ends after you've given him nine Deathroot.<br /><br />
<b>Fia:</b> You can start <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia's</a> quest by speaking to her in her room in the Roundtable Hold. She'll only speak to you in secret if you let her hold you. Doing so will give you Baldachin's Blessing, which decreases your maximum HP while it's in your inventory.<br /><br />
<b>Brother Corhyn:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corhyn's</a> quest won't be started until a little later, but you can speak to him now for introductions and to purchase some incantations.<br /><br />
<b>Diallos:</b> You can start <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Diallos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diallos'</a> quest by speaking to him here. Simply exhaust his dialogue then he'll show up in another location later on.<br /><br />
The most important thing to do here right now is to ensure that you <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upgrade</a> your weapons as much as possible as <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormveil+Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormveil Castle</a> is a difficult endeavor and you will need all the help you can get.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Liurnia of the Lakes East Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1466&lat=-171.09375&lng=87.487072&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Liurnia of the Lakes East Starting Point</a>. We'll tackle this area from the bottom heading up, just to make it easier to navigate. Head southeast from the Liurnia Highway South site of grace and collect the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Treespear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treespear</a> weapon (found on the Caravan left at the edge of the collapsed bridge). From here head to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cliffbottom+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cliffbottom Catacombs</a> (located east of the Liurnia Highway North grace, then follow the path south) to gather valuable upgrade materials <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (2)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (3)</a> as well as the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Kaiden+Sellsword+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaiden Sellsword Ashes</a> that is excellent for early game tanking. Slightly North-West from here, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Purified+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purified Ruins</a> has a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shabriri+Grape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shabriri Grape</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hyetta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyetta</a>'s second location.<br /><br />
<b>Highway Lookout Tower & Night's Cavalry:</b> Head further north and stop by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Highway+Lookout+Tower+(Liurnia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highway Lookout Tower (Liurnia)</a> to obtain Carian Glintblade Staff and Glintstone Craftman's Cookbook (3), then return to the main road. You will encounter a group of undead fighting soldiers, and a giant Spirit Skeleton. You can fight them or run by, your destination is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1512&lat=-149.7969&lng=77.477&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gate Town Bridge site of grace</a>. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hyetta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyetta</a>'s third location is by the Site of Grace, but you won't find the next Shabriri Grape until a little later. Wait until night to fight a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Cavalry</a> that drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ice+Spear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Spear</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ashes+of+War" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Eastern Slopes & Artist's Shack:</b> Backtrack south to Liurnia Highway North and head further east up the slopes until you come to a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tibia+Mariner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibia Mariner</a> boss, a valuable <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a>, and can pick up <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Skeletal+Bandit+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeletal Bandit Ashes</a>. Further north, defeat a patrolling knight to obtain the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Cult+Prayerbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Cult Prayerbook</a>. Beware of his lightning strikes! Further north from here, visit an Artist's Shack to obtain a Painting item: the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Resurrection+Painting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Resurrection" Painting</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Site+of+Grace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Site of Grace</a>. Loot a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (4)</a> from a corpse East of the shack before heading to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jarburg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarburg</a> south from here.<br /><br />
<b>Jarburg & Jar Bairn's Quest:</b> In order to get to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jarburg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarburg</a>, go back to the tower north of where you fought the Tibia Mariner. Go to the edge of the cliff directly south of the tower and look down. You'll be able to see some stone platforms you can safely jump down to (for a more successful descend, jump down by foot instead of using Torrent). Head to the very bottom to reach <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jarburg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarburg</a>. <strong>Don't</strong> attack the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living Jars</a> here, they're peaceful. Speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jar+Bairn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jar Bairn</a>, the little jar sitting at the edge of a stone structure, to start his quest. Keep exhausting his dialogue and reloading the area until he talks about Alexander not returning to the village - that'll be his last piece of dialogue until the next part of his quest.<br /><br />
<b>Church of Vows & Carian Study Hall:</b> You must now go back to ground level to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1517&lat=-138.75&lng=75.351&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eastern Liurnia Lake Shore</a> site of grace (if you didn't reach this grace yet, just head Northeast from the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Academy+Gate+Town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy Gate Town</a> grace). Follow it East and then <strong>north</strong> to continue exploring this area. (To the south, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Study+Hall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carian Study Hall</a> cannot yet be completed as you are missing a key item you will obtain later from this NPC (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni the Witch</a>)). The road north has two paths: One has a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golem</a> that is guarding access to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ainsel+River+Well" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsel River Well</a>. We will go there later. Take the other path up the slopes and unlock the Eastern Tableland site of grace. The area to the south-west of the site of grace will have an Incantation (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flame+Cleanse+Me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flame, Cleanse Me!</a>) and the enemies here have a chance to drop items from the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Monk+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire Monk Set</a>. Stay the road and access the higher ground to arrive at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Vows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of Vows</a> and meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miriel+Pastor+of+Vows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miriel, Pastor of Vows</a> who can teach you both <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantations</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorceries</a>, receive Scrolls and Prayerbooks, and give you <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lore</a> information. This location is important because it allows you to cleanse your SIN (aggro'd NPCs) by using <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celestial Dew</a> and performing an "Absolution" at the altar. You will also find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gold+Sewing+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Sewing Needle</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Tailoring+Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Tailoring Tools</a> (key items for boss armor alteration)<br /><br />
<b>Minor Erdtree & Crystal Tunnel:</b> Now follow the road east and north to unlock two minor <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Walking+Mausoleum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walking Mausoleums</a> and visit the Minor Erdtree. Here you will fight the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdtree Avatar</a>, and can loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lightning-Shrouding+Cracked+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightning-Shrouding Cracked Tear</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Holy-Shrouding+Cracked+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Magic-Shrouding+Cracked+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear</a>. Once these are obtained, follow the road west until you hit the cliffside and find the gravestones that allow you to drop down to ground level. You should find the spirit spring that is alongside the cliffs of this area and time your jump so you land atop the big Bell Mausoleum to destroy the white skulls and unlock it. From here, go east toward the red spot marked on your map to find and complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raya+Lucaria+Crystal+Tunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel</a>. Within the tunnel you will find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing-Stone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (1)</a> as well as upgrade stones level <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 and 3</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Frenzy-Flaming Tower & Madness:</b> Exit the tunnel and find your way up and north into Bellum Highway. Take the eastern side of the map and follow it north until it opens up. This will be your first encounter with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Madness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madness</a> effect. Stay out of sight of the "Eye of Sauron" you can see in the distance! Increase your <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Focus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus</a> stat with equipment or use a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> and Godrick's Rune to make madness buildup slower. If you want to put an end to the madness, stick to the west side as you approach the slope toward the flames, and use the spiritspring to jump into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzy-Flaming+Tower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzy-Flaming Tower</a> and defeat the rats and villagers within.<br /><br />
<b>Frenzied Flame Village & Church of Inhibition:</b> Unlock the nearby site of grace called <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied+Flame+Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied Flame Village Outskirts</a>, then set south into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied+Flame+Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied Flame Village</a>: Pick up <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied's+Cookbook+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied's Cookbook (1)</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shabriri's+Woe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shabriri's Woe</a> talisman. Press on west and up the slopes and defeat a Teardrop Scarab for the incantation <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied+Burst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied Burst</a> and head further north-west toward the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Inhibition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of Inhibition</a>. On the way, you'll get invaded by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Festering+Fingerprint+Vyke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Festering Fingerprint Vyke</a>, who'll drop the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fingerprint+Grape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingerprint Grape</a> upon defeat. This is used for Hyetta's questline so make a note of it.<br /><br />
<b>Varre's Quest Progression:</b> Head into the Church of Inhibition to get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Finger+Maiden+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finger Maiden Set</a>.

<b>Converted Fringe Tower:</b> Return to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied+Flame+Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied Flame Village Outskirts</a> Site of Grace, and travel further east from it, going around the edge (you'll encounter a Glintstone Troll) leading to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Converted+Fringe+Tower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Converted Fringe Tower</a>. Equip any Glintstone Crown helm, stand in front of the seal, and perform the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gestures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erudition Gesture</a> to break the seal.

<b>Black Knife Catacombs & Rogier's Quest:</b> Go back down the tower and move over to the cliff nearby west of here. You'll see some platforms that you can use to get down. Do this to access <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knife+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Knife Catacombs</a> guarded by a Phantom Knight with a death-enchanted blade.

<b>Yura's Quest & Bellum Church:</b> If for any reason you skipped this step earlier: Travel back to the Main Academy Gate Site of Grace and head north past the seal. You'll find an invasion sign from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloody+Finger+Hunter+Yura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yura</a> asking for assistance. Defeat the target, then exhaust Yura's dialogue when you return to your world. Go back to examine the seal you ran past. It'll teleport you to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raya+Lucaria+Academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Raya Lucaria Gate</a> Site of Grace.

We'll hold off giving him the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gold+Sewing+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Sewing Needle</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Tailoring+Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Tailoring Tools</a> until he's reached his final location to make sure his quest doesn't inadvertently end.

This is a pretty easy area to tackle even earlier on, however it makes sense to visit it now because it follows a "natural" path from Liurnia East. You will be able to loot several <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (3)</a> here that allow you to upgrade your weapons to +9, making Liurnia West easier. Head left from the Site of Grace and defeat the many Ants you'll encounter until you arrive at an open area with many <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Clayman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clayman</a> humanoid enemies. Here, loot several <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Upgrade+Materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upgrade Materials</a> and then you should take a non-obvious path to the RIGHT of the wall blocking your progress, as this will enable you to hide from the lazer-beam bug that would terrorize other approach. Use this right path and the broken pillars to quickly make your way across and get BEHIND the giant monster (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Malformed+Star" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malformed Star</a>). From here you'll be able to tackle it much easier and not be overwhelmed by other enemies. It will not respawn once defeated.<br /><br />
<b>Exploration and Boss:</b> Loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Ainsel+River)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Ainsel River)</a> and talk to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Merchant+Ainsel+River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Merchant (Ainsel River)</a> to check out his shop. There's a curved sword (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wing+of+Astel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wing of Astel</a>) that can be looted from a chest in the upper area if you want to explore around (This upper area can only be accessed later during <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's sidequest</a>). Once you've gathered materials take the path downstream and confront several more giant ants and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">basilisks</a>, then get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Immunizing+Horn+Charm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immunizing Horn Charm</a>. Keep following the river until you arrive at a boss room where you can fight the Great Enemy: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonkin+Soldier+of+Nokstella" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella</a> and get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frozen+Lightning+Spear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frozen Lightning Spear</a> incantation. There's nothing else that can be done in this zone right now so we'll head back up to Liurnia of the Lakes and explore its western shores.<br /><br />

Begin Exploration by accessing the Site of Grace: Folly on the Lake (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=937&lat=-153.265625&lng=58.258712&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map coordinates here</a>). Ride Torrent to avoid being poisoned and explore the cavernous swamp. From the Site of Grace, head south and then hug the wall and keep going north. Eventually, you will notice a road heading up into a town - this is <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Village+of+the+Albinaurics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Village of the Albinaurics</a> and has a VERY important item you don't want to miss. As you make your way up the slope, you can talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nepheli+Loux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nepheli Loux</a> to progress her quest. If she dies for any reason, there will be 2x <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhawk+Axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormhawk Axe</a> in her location. Ahead from here, you can loot 1x <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tear</a> from a coffin, and you'll come to a well and an NPC ghost that talks about <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Albus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albus</a>. Activate the site of grace and put the well to your back and go forward and left up a slope toward the Perfumer enemy. Past the perfumer, there's a suspicious POT. Hit the pot and it will transform into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Albus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albus</a>, who gives you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligtree+Secret+Medallion+(Right)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)</a>. This item is ESSENTIAL to access a later area of the game, but it can also be used to advance <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Latenna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latenna</a>'s quest. Travel to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Slumbering+Wolf's+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slumbering Wolf's Shack</a> and talk to her, show her the medallion and agree to help her to progress her questline.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Caelid Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=983&lat=-169.328125&lng=124.477279&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Caelid Starting Point</a>. Exploring <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caelid</a> can be a challenging task for players. The western area is quite easy at this point, but the east area is tough and the north (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonbarrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonbarrow</a>) is best tackled later on. Many players may prefer to take the path North from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Liurnia+of+the+Lakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liurnia of the Lakes</a> and through the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruin-Strewn+Precipice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruin-Strewn Precipice</a> to explore the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Altus+Plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altus Plateau</a> first (especially if you want to access the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sealed+Tunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sealed Tunnel</a> as early as possible for the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing-Stone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+[2]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [2]</a> to freely upgrade any normal weapons up to +12, which you would need to tackle both at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Altus+Plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altus Plateau</a> and Caelid). You can even go to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mt+Gelmir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mt Gelmir</a> before coming to Caelid. The reason this walkthrough opts to visit Caelid first is because there is little of consequence in Altus for the story, some NPC <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Side+Quests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questlines</a> start in Caelid, you find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dectus+Medallion+(Right)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dectus Medallion (Right)</a> in Caelid which leads <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Altus+Plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altus Plateau</a> being a natural progression point *after* Caelid, and Mt. Gelmir is intended as higher level (upgrades there are +15-20 and +6-8 while Caelid is +10-14 and +4-5).<br /><br />
If you decide to tackle Caelid, then continue reading from here. If you want to do Altus, then scroll down to it using this <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Game+Progress+Route#altusfirst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handy click</a>. We will include a way to return to this point from the end of Altus as well.<br /><br />
<b>Entering Caelid:</b> To get into Caelid, you can start from the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Summonwater+Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summonwater Village Outskirts</a> site of grace and head Northeast past the Summonwater Village and follow the path until you get to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1101&lat=-170.920313&lng=128.101498&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotview Balcony</a> site of grace. There are some items in the buildings around the site of grace with some surprise attacks waiting when you grab them. Kill the monsters, loot the items, and head northwest to the Smoldering Church.<br /><br />
<b>Smoldering Church & Minor Erdtree:</b> Your first objective as you enter is to complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smoldering+Church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smoldering Church</a>. There's an NPC invasion here by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Anastasia,+Tarnished-Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater</a> who drops a talisman, but the church also has 2 cookbooks that you want: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Warrior's+Cookbook+(14)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (14)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Missionary's+Cookbook+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missionary's Cookbook (3)</a>. From here you will want to activate the site of grace at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shack+of+the+Rotting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shack of the Rotting</a> to make sure you have an easy respawn if things go badly. Follow the road forward from the Smoldering Church and you will come to the Minor Erdtree of the area. Defeat the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrid Avatar</a> and get <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flame-Shrouding+Cracked+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greenburst+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenburst Crystal Tear</a>. You can then opt to explore the nearby <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Erdtree Catacombs</a>, you can loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (5)</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mad+Pumpkin+Head" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mad Pumpkin Head</a> Spirit Ashes from a duo boss within. After this continue following the road and you can loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatsword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greatsword</a> from the travelling wagon. Ahead there are some ruins with a duo of Pumpkin Head mini-bosses that let you loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Visage+Shield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visage Shield</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Abandoned Cave:</b> Grab the Smoldering Wall site of grace near the telescope icon on the map. Travel east from the telescope icon and head towards the canyon. Look for exposed tree roots to jump onto and cross the canyon to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abandoned+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abandoned Cave</a>. Make sure to use gear with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Immunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immunity</a> to fight against the pools of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scarlet+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Rot</a>, and have some <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Preserving+Boluses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preserving Boluses</a> at hand! The <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cleanrot+Knight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleanrot Knight</a> boss duo within can be challenging, but they drop the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gold+Scarab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Scarab</a> talisman that can make rune farming a lot faster. There's also the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Serpent+Bow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serpent Bow</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Venomous+Fang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venomous Fang</a> claw weapon to loot here.<br /><br />
<b>Gael Tunnel & Fort Gael:</b> Return to the Smoldering Wall site of grace just south of the telescope icon. To the west of this location, back toward Limgrave but on the lower level, you can find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gael+Tunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gael Tunnel</a> and challenge the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Magma+Wyrm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magma Wyrm</a> to get 1 <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Heart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Heart</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moonveil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonveil</a> (the Katana all PvPers love!). Explore thoroughly and find rear Gael Tunnel entrance to trigger your second encounter with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander</a>. (If for whatever reason you don't find him here, you'll find him later at the festival.) There are several upgrade materials to be looted in and out of the tunnel so make sure to check the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map</a>. You can also kill an invisible Teardrop Scarab near the tunnel's exit to loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Flame+of+the+Redmanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Flame of the Redmanes</a>. NOTE: The invisible Teardrop Scarab that offers Flame of Redmanes can be found just northeast of the Fort Gael North site of grace. Listen for a tinkling bell sound, and then a trail of sparkles on the ground running around in circles. Get in the path of the circle and time your attack correctly to hit it and get its Ash of War. Further south from here you will be able to explore <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fort+Gael" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fort Gael</a>. There's <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Heirloom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starscourge Heirloom</a>, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Katar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katar</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Lion's+Claw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Lion's Claw</a> inside the fort building. At the top of the fort building, there is a gateway leading to a location east of the Impassable Greatbridge (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site of grace</a>) in South Eastern Caelid near Redmane Castle. Don't take it right now if you want to continue exploring naturally, but you can progress this way if you want to. Behind the building, there are two flame thrower vehicles and between them there's a body on which you can find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flame+Grant+me+Strength" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flame, Grant Me Strength</a> incantation.<br /><br />
<b>Gaol Cave:</b> Find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gaol+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaol Cave</a> to the northeast in the canyon and unlock it with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Keys</a>. Within you will find some upgrade materials, a shield, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied+Duelist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied Duelist</a> boss that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Corpse+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrid Corpse Ashes</a>. The rear entrance of the cave allows you to drop down to an item that's technically in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Limgrave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limgrave</a>: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Regalia+of+Echoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regalia of Echoid</a> (Straight Sword).<br /><br />
<b>Southern Caelid Highway:</b> Make your way southeast, and loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Meteoric+Ore+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meteoric Ore Blade</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid+Waypoint+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caelid Waypoint Ruins</a>. Go back to the road and follow it south to the Caelid Highway South site of grace. Just south of the site of grace is a dragon with Scarlet Rot breath named <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Decaying+Ekzykes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decaying Ekzykes</a>. Killing him is optional, but provides another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Heart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Heart</a> and makes a Scarlet Rot breath incantation, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ekzykes's+Decay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ekzykes's Decay</a>, available at the Churches of Dragon Communion. Further along the road, find the area's <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Caelid)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Caelid)</a>. Near the map site, you will find a merchant here that sells Stonesword Key and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Warrior's+Cookbook+(15)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (15)</a>. The <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4514&lat=-185.339061&lng=144.359712&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Aeonia Swampbank</a> site of grace is just Northeast of the merchant. Visiting this location at night will let you challenge the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Cavalry</a> of the area and obtain his drop: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Poison+Moth+Flight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Poison Moth Flight</a>. Slightly east from here, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Rite+Bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Rite Bird</a> also spawns at night, and drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death's+Poker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death's Poker</a> greatsword.<br /><br />
<b>Cathedral of Dragon Communion & Caelid Catacombs:</b> Explore the road South from the fork by the merchant and loot a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>, then go westward to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+Dragon+Communion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cathedral of Dragon Communion</a>, that allows you to buy special Dragon Incantations based on the dragons that you have defeated. Loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Apostle's+Cookbook+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook (3)</a> before leaving. Explore nearby to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caelid Catacombs</a>, which is directly east near the road following the cliffs nearby, then following a right U-turn heading west, past which you'll encounter a Teardrop Scarab holding a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+[4]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone [4]</a>. Inside the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caelid Catacombs</a> there's an illusory wall that hides <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+Sprout+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miranda Ashes</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Kindred+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindred of Rot</a> ashes can also be obtained within, alongside upgrade materials.<br /><br />
You can now opt to follow the road south and east to visit and complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redmane Castle</a>, or go north toward the swamp and explore Sellia.<br /><br />
<b>Swamp of Aeonia & Sellia Crystal Tunnel:</b> To complete exploration, start the swamp from the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1154&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astray from Caelid Highway North</a> site of grace that is just south of the Telescope icon on your map. There's a teardrop scarab that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Lifesteal+Fist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Lifesteal Fist</a>, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Merchant+Caelid+Highway+North" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">merchant</a> with some uninteresting consumables. Go into the swamp and slightly north to find several useful items, including the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Meteorite+Staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meteorite Staff</a> and the spell <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rock+Sling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock Sling</a>, in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Street+of+Sages+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street of Sages Ruins</a>. The very north of the swamp has Sellia Crystal Tunnel - you may have been teleported here earlier by the trap chest in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon-Burnt+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon-Burnt Ruins</a>. Get your revenge on the enemies within and defeat the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fallingstar+Beast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallingstar Beast</a> to get <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somberstone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (1)</a> and unlock Somberstone purchases at the Roundtable Hold.<br /><br />
<b>Sellia, Town of Sorcery & Commander O'Neil:</b> To the east of the Swamp is <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia,+Town+of+Sorcery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia, Town of Sorcery</a>. This is an important location with many items to pick up. Notably, you will meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gowry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gowry</a> at his shack just north of Sellia Gateway, who will task you with defeating <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Commander+O'Neil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commander O'Neil</a> in the swamp to obtain the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Unalloyed+Gold+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unalloyed Gold Needle</a>. Commander O'Neil can be found in a large clearing within Aeonia Swamp in eastern Caelid. Players can easily reach his arena by traveling southwest from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia,+Town+of+Sorcery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia, Town of Sorcery</a> (a further up north), looking for a large group of trees in a circular formation and jumping over the mutated growths with Torrent.<br /><br />
<b>Millicent's Quest Begins:</b> After you defeat Commander O'Neil, return the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Unalloyed+Gold+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unalloyed Gold Needle</a> to Gowry so he can repair it. Reload the area and talk to him again to get the repaired <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Unalloyed+Gold+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unalloyed Gold Needle</a>. Next we should visit <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+the+Plague" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of the Plague</a> to meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Millicent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millicent</a>., however we must first make a little progress inside <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia,+Town+of+Sorcery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia, Town of Sorcery</a> before we can reach the church. Read the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia,+Town+of+Sorcery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia, Town of Sorcery</a> page for a proper walkthrough of the area. There is useful loot in there but of particular note is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> and Imbued Sword Key. After finishing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia,+Town+of+Sorcery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia, Town of Sorcery</a>, you can take the path north, up the stairs and up the mountain, to the Church of the Plague and talk to Millicent and hand over the Unalloyed Gold Needle to her. Be sure to loot the Sacred Tear in the church. Reload the area and speak to her to obtain the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prosthesis-Wearer+Heirloom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom</a>. Return to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gowry's+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gowry's Shack</a> to find Millicent again. Don't forget to exhaust her dialogue to move her to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Altus+Plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altus Plateau</a> for later.<br /><br />
<b>Redmane Castle & Starscourge Radahn:</b> It is now time to take on Redmane Castle. See the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Redmane+Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redmane Castle</a> page for information on how to navigate and loot it, and challenge <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Radahn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starscourge Radahn</a> to progress the game. Be sure to speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Fist Alexander</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blaidd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blaidd</a> before fighting Radahn. (Note: After defeating the duo bosses at Redmane Castle, if the Old Geezer has a dialogue loop where he mentions that he "no use for you yet", assuming you've accepted <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's</a> quest earlier in the walkthrough, go speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/War+Counselor+Iji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iji</a> at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1507&lat=-114.875&lng=52.924561&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Road To The Manor grace</a>, nearby <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caria+Manor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caria Manor</a>. He should talk about the Festival. Exhaust his dialogue, and fast travel back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4543&lat=-193.703&lng=159.141&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redmane Castle Plaza grace</a>, where all the NPCs now should have gathered at the Plaza. Now you can challenge Starscourge Radahn. Good luck!) After you defeat him, you can talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Fist Alexander</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blaidd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blaidd</a> near the site of grace. You can now explore the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/War-Dead+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">War-Dead Catacombs</a> to the north of the arena (you may want to leave them for later as they are quite challenging maybe level 80+).<br /><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If you want to save Nokron Eternal City, Liurnia of the Lakes (West), Nokstella Eternal City / Lake of Rot, and the Deeproot Depths for later and instead tackle Atlus Plateau, you may do so since it will be level-appropriate for your character, and there's no consequence for it. Otherwise, continue reading from here.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Nokron Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1545&lat=-185.742187&lng=121.299656&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Nokron Starting Point</a>. With <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Radahn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starscourge Radahn</a> defeated, a new region underground is now accessible. If you go back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/War+Counselor+Iji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iji</a>, he has some dialogue about <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blaidd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blaidd</a>. Head back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mistwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mistwood</a> and south-east of the Mistwood Ruins, Blaidd has left a message near the edge of the newly formed crater. These next few steps are completely optional. Head back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forlorn+Hound+Evergaol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forlorn Hound Evergaol</a> to find Blaidd. After you choose to let him out or keep him in there, you can head back to Iji to talk about it. When you're done with that, teleport back to Mistwood and make your way south until you find a huge crater in the area west of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fort+Haight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fort Haight</a>. Descend down the crater using platforms found in its the eastern side and eventually you'll arrive at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nokron,+Eternal+City" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nokron, Eternal City</a>. On the way, make sure to keep an eye out for corpses that have a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Rune+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Rune [5]</a> and two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Soporific+Grease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soporific Grease</a> on them.<br /><br />
<b>Nokron Outskirts:</b> At this point you're just in the outskirts of Nokron. This Eternal City shares a map fragment with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siofra River</a>, so navigating this area may get confusing; even opening your map right now shows you're outside of the map. From here though, getting to the main part of the city is pretty straightforward. Carefully, navigate the jumps downward while on Torrent and eventually head through a tunnel that initiates a no horse zone.<br /><br />
<b>Path to the City:</b> Up past the tunnel there is a plank way and then a pillar top that you can jump on. To the right, you will notice an item on the roof, but the jump is just a little too far. You may even see a white spirit appear to make the jump. However, if you try the jump, you will likely fall. An option is to wield the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Winged+Scythe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winged Scythe</a> that you found in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tombsward+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tombsward Ruins</a> and use its special attack to make the jump across the gap, make another special attack jump to get across a second gap to get to the rooftop, and eventually pick up the item which is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghostflame+torch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghostflame Torch</a>. Now, jump down and get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> off a corpse laying up on the roof. Head north scaling up the building, and go through one of the windows on the side of the standing building that opens into a cavern. Before dropping down to where the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fallen+Hawks+Soldier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallen Hawks Soldiers</a> are, make sure to loot the corpses on this ledge for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Furlcalling+Finger+Remedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Furlcalling Finger Remedy</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone [5]</a>. After clearing out the enemies and collecting the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort [3]</a>, head through the doorway to the north to interact with the Nokron, Eternal City Site of Grace and you will now emerge into the heart of the city.<br /><br />
<b>Heart of the City:</b> Right ahead, lying on the steps of a gazebo is a corpse that has the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost-Glovewort+Picker's+Bell+Bearing+(1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [1]</a> on them. There are corpses strewn around that have various levels of Smithing Stones and Somber Smithing Stones on them, as well as Ghost Gloveworts that you can collect. If you head east, next to the stairs going down, you'll find a small graveyard where you can collect the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatshield+Soldier+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greatshield Soldier Ashes</a>, and two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort [3]</a>. In the building opposite to this graveyard, you'll find a corpse inside with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tear</a> guarded by two Fallen Hawks Soldiers.<br /><br />
<b>Path to Mimic Tear:</b> When you're done collecting items in this area, descend down the stairs going eastward and turn right at the corner. You'll be able to see a fog door in the distance. Head towards it, looting the corpses on the way for another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tear</a>, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort [3]</a>, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Rune+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Rune [7]</a>. At the bottom of the crumbling steps turn around for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> on a dead body. When you're ready to face the boss, transverse through the mist. You'll find yourself in a large temple ruin with no boss to be seen. Approach the center of the arena and the slime puddle will reveal itself to be the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mimic+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimic Tear</a>, transforming into your character. Defeat it for the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Tear+Mask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Tear Mask</a>, two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tears</a>, and to be able to progress further into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nokron,+Eternal+City" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nokron, Eternal City</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Night's Sacred Ground:</b> Upon exiting the arena, cross the bridge and as soon as it's safe to, turn left and get off the bridge. Walk westwards until you reach the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1580&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancestral Woods Site of Grace</a>. Facing south-west, jump down to the roof of the building. Don't worry about collecting items in the north-east yet, we'll be back here later. Jump down to the next building's ledge and turn right, then jump down to the corpse hanging over the banister. You've reached <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Sacred+Ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Sacred Ground</a>, but the safe way down might not be too obvious yet. Continue following the edge of this building and you'll find another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> on a corpse at the top of the large stairs to your right. Turn back around and jump down to the next building where there's two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Tears</a> hanging out. Head east after defeating them, following the building's edge, then walk across the wall ruin to reach the open windows on the other side. You should now find yourself in the main temple of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Sacred+Ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Sacred Ground</a>. On the corpse slumped in front of the altar, you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Whetblade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Whetblade</a>. Head through the hallway to the east and you'll find an imp statue next to a door that has to be unlocked with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a>. Within, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Swordstress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swordstress</a>, a chest containing the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mimic+Tear+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimic Tear Ashes</a>, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone [3]</a>. Head back through the hallway and head down to the bottom floor of the temple. The large silver ball is actually a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Tear</a> in disguise, and it drops a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tear</a> upon defeat. You'll be finding a few more of these disguised Silver Tears in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nokstella,+Eternal+City" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nokstella, Eternal City</a> if you're looking for more of these drops. Head out the entrance of the temple and descend the stairs to find a Site of Grace to your left.<br /><br />
<b>The Fingerslayer Blade:</b> After you've rested, continue northeast up the road, defeating enemies and pillaging corpses for loot, including a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celestial Dew</a>, along the way. It should be noted that the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Tear</a> right at the base of the stairs transforms into a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troll</a>. At the top of the stairs and underneath the massive skeleton on it's throne, you'll find a chest containing the Hidden Treasure of Nokron, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fingerslayer+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingerslayer Blade</a>, as well as a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Ghost Glovewort</a>. The waygate next to this giant statue will take you back up to the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Ancestral Woods & Regal Ancestor Spirit:</b> Feel free to explore this hilly part of Nokron and it's ruins to collect valuable items such as a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Clarifying+Horn+Charm+1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarifying Horn Charm +1</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mottled+Necklace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mottled Necklace</a> (+1), <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celestial Dew</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Enchanted+Shot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Enchanted Shot</a>. While you explore, you may have noticed that there's another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hallowhorn+Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallowhorn Grounds</a> here with unlit obelisks, like that in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siofra River</a>. The altars you need to activate can be found in the following places:
<ul>
<li>First Pillar is by the cliff's edge, next to the broken bridge you took to get here. [<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3853&lat=-179.625&lng=132.781009&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>]</li>
<li>Second Pillar is by the side of the brick road. [<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3852&lat=-180.359375&lng=131.067153&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>]</li>
<li>Third Pillar is up on the ledge next to the brick road with an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancestral+Follower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancestral Follower</a> singing by it. [<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3858&lat=-178.9375&lng=129.445743&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>]</li>
<li>Fouth Pillar is found by a large rock. [<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3857&lat=-177.523437&lng=127.398852&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>]</li>
<li>Fifth Pillar is by the cliff's edge, next to a submerged ruins and guarded by some <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Rat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Rats</a> and chanting Ancestral Followers. [<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3856&lat=-174.132812&lng=127.906287&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>]</li>
<li>Sixth Pillar is behind a deer carcass in a ruin right beside the Hallowhorn Grounds. [<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3855&lat=-176.625&lng=130.524048&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>]</li>
</ul>
When you get to the Fifth Pillar, it may be worth taking a detour to the submerged ruins down in the water. You'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort (5)</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancestral+Infant's+Head" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancestral Infant's Head</a> in a chest at the far end of the ruins. Once all six altars are lit, head back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hallowhorn+Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallowhorn Grounds</a> to challenge the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Regal+Ancestor+Spirit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regal Ancestor Spirit</a> and obtain the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Regal+Ancestor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Regal Ancestor</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Siofra Aqueduct:</b> Now, head over to the cliff behind the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hallowhorn+Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallowhorn Grounds</a> where there's a bunch of spirit jellyfish. If you look down, there's a small ledge you can jump to. To your right is a corpse with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a> on it, and to your left a cavern with the Aqueduct-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace. Follow the path further down to the end of the cave and look down to see a support structure you can jump down to. This long structure is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+Aqueduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siofra Aqueduct</a>. There are some branching platforms on the outer walls of the aqueduct with valuable items such as the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Order+Healing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order Healing</a> spell, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a>, and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Missionary's+Cookbook+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missionary's Cookbook (5)</a>. You'll also find an NPC sitting on the outer section of the aqueduct who gives you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gestures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inner Order Gesture</a> in exchange for the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twinned+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twinned Armor Set</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Valiant Gargoyles & Path to Deeproot Depths:</b> Navigate your way to the lowest level of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+Aqueduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siofra Aqueduct</a>, and exit the structure to emerge into a cavern at the base of a large waterfall. As you approach it, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Valiant+Gargoyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valiant Gargoyle</a> will jump down from the ceiling, and after taking him to about half health, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Valiant+Gargoyle+(Twinblade)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valiant Gargoyle (Twinblade)</a> jumps down to join him in the fight. Defeat them both and you'll be rewarded with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gargoyle's+Greatsword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gargoyle's Greatsword</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gargoyle's+Twinblade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gargoyle's Twinblade</a>. The Great Waterfall Basin Site of Grace will be accessible after this boss fight. Resting in the coffin north of the site of grace will deliver you to the secret area of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deeproot+Depths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeproot Depths</a>, in which you can progress <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia</a>'s quest.

<b>Ranni's Quest & The Carian Study Hall:</b> You're going to be finishing up the underground areas next. But before that, return to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni's+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's Rise</a> to hand over the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fingerslayer+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingerslayer Blade</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni</a> asked you to retrieve.
<strong>[ ! ] Please Note:</strong> If you want to do <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Preceptor+Seluvis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seluvis'</a> questline, Or if you want to give his potion to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater</a>, you should hold off on delivering the Fingerslayer Blade until this is completed. You should also be aware that a choice must be made at the end of Seluvis' questline and you'll be given the option to betray an associated character. Nothing will be gained from this attempted betrayal and you'll antagonize that character, but absolution can be found at the Church of Vows.
You'll have to seek absolution or not do the final step if you wish to continue Ranni's quest after doing Seluvis's. Since nothing can be gained from the betrayal, it is reccomended to avoid it.
Give the treasure of Nokron (the blade) to Ranni and she'll reward you with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Inverted+Statue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carian Inverted Statue</a>, which when reading the description tells you to head to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Study+Hall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carian Study Hall</a> (big tower in Central Eastern Liurnia, near Jarburg). You may recall a tall globe just by the entrance of the study hall. Interact with the pedestal just in front of it to place the Carian Inverted Statue and a cutscene will play.<br /><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If you have not visited the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Study+Hall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carian Study Hall</a> before this point, you may wish to explore it <strong>before</strong> interacting with the pedestal and using the inverted statue. This gives you the opportunity to get some loot, and you can also snipe some fingercreepers on ledges so that you won't have to fight them later.<br /><br />
<b>Inverted Carian Study Hall & Divine Tower:</b> Head to the elevator shaft and enter the secret area through the small window. Right off the bat, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Preceptor+Miriam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preceptor Miriam</a> will start attacking you. Fight back with ranged attacks or close the distance by turning right and heading down the side of the walls. After you've defeated her and taken her loot, you can find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mask+of+Confidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mask of Confidence</a> on a corpse on the left side of the room, opposite to where you came down from. Continue heading down by jumping down platforms and beams until you reach a button on a platform in the middle of the room. The platform takes you down to a bridge, with the Liurnia Tower Bridge site of grace at the beginning, guarded by a large enemy. Whether you choose to defeat it or simply run away from it, crossing the bridge takes you to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Tower+of+Liurnia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine Tower of Liurnia</a>. Following the ladders and stairs up to the top will take you to a body that can be looted for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stargazer+Heirloom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stargazer Heirloom</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cursemark+of+Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cursemark of Death</a>, a key item for <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia's</a> quest.<br /><br />
<b>Aftermath & Collectibles:</b> Finishing this step in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's</a> questline unlocks other collectible items. Ranni herself disappears from her tower and speaking to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/War+Counselor+Iji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iji</a> gives you insights on where she's gone. If you head to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seluvis's+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seluvis's Rise</a>, you will find that you now have access to Seluvis' armor set, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Preceptor's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preceptor's Set</a>, and other items related to him, and you can find Ranni's armor set, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Snow+Witch+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snow Witch Set</a>, in a chest up the ladder in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Renna's+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renna's Rise</a>. If you head back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pidia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pidia</a> in Caria Manor, you can witness an interesting scene and pick up <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pidia's+Bell+Bearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pidia's Bell Bearing</a> & <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dolores+the+Sleeping+Arrow+Puppet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Iron Fist Alexander:</b> While you are in Liurnia, make sure to explore the area in the East where you found the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tibia+Mariner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibia Mariner</a> just south from the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Carian+Study+Hall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carian Study Hall</a> and meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Fist Alexander</a>. Use an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oil+Pot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oil Pot</a> to free him. (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=5416&lat=-147.031&lng=81.906&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See it on the map</a>). Note that if you found Alexander in Mt. Gelmir where the Magma Wyrm is prior to seeing him near the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jarburg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarburg</a> village, this part of his quest will be skipped, but will still proceed as normal.<br /><br />
From here, we will visit Deeproot Depths to advance Fia's questline.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Deeproot Depths Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4583&lat=-103.039&lng=124.305&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Deeproot Depths Starting Point</a>. This is a special location only accessible by teleporting in from the coffin in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+Aqueduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siofra Aqueduct</a>, so it's easy to miss. The area is important to progress <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia</a>'s questline, and gives the player a chance to align with a specific faction for the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Endings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endings</a>. The area offers <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (4)</a> to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(6)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort (4)</a> to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(6)</a>, so you should have your upgrades over 15 or +6 for special.<br /><br />
<b>Great Waterfall Crest & The Roots:</b> You will spawn in a watery area in the underground beneath Lyndell. This is Great Waterfall Crest. Nearby, defeat an Erdtree Avatar enemy and loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Staff+of+the+Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Staff of the Avatar</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Golden+Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Golden Land</a>. From here, cross the ravine to the west by carefully following the roots. Following one of the roots towards the northwest leads into a cave with a large amount of ants and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Stars</a> incantation at the end. Cross the ravine afterwards and head past the square with the flying ants to meet the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Finger+Reader+Crone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palm Reader</a> near the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4582&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeproot Depths site of grace</a> for some lore of this location.<br /><br />
<b>The Nameless Eternal City:</b> Navigate the roots north toward the flooded ruins, past what seems like an army of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basilisks</a>, until you find a gazebo with a corpse that holds <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Deeproot+Depths)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Deeproot Depths)</a>. The building nearby has <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Vacuum+Slice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Vacuum Slice</a> within it. From here, you will want to ignore most enemies and travel northwest to "The Nameless Eternal City" site of grace. A coffin nearby teleports you to Ainsel River main, but your objective is to get to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Walking+Mausoleum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walking Mausoleum</a> roaming nearby and deactivate it, as it will de-spawn all the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mausoleum+Knight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mausoleum Knight</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mausoleum+Soldier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mausoleum Soldier</a> enemies.<br /><br />
<b>Deactivating the Mausoleum:</b> To deactivate the Mausoleum, go to the lower area north from the site of grace and all the way to the west. Loot the Stonesword Key while you're here, then take the spirit spring up. You will land by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Knight+Siluria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crucible Knight Siluria</a>, which should be a straight-forward fight at this point. Defeat it and loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Tree+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crucible Tree Set</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siluria's+Tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siluria's Tree</a>. Now head east toward the branches and quickly navigate across them to a point here you can jump ONTO the mausoleum. There are basilisks and archers that will interrupt your progress so it's best to dismount from Torrent as you get closer to the mausoleum. Once on it, hit the white skulls until it stops. This will de-spawn all Mausoleum-type enemies.<br /><br />
<b>Fia's Champions:</b> You are now free to roam and loot any other objects in the area, before heading back up to "The Nameless Eternal City" site of grace and heading east to take the main branches up. You will deal with some fire-breathing Broken Statue enemies as you attempt to cross, and you will then arrive at the "Across the Roots" site of grace. Nearby, an entrance gives you access to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia's+Champions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia's Champions</a> boss fight. Fia's Champions are five randomized invader enemies and are found in Deeproot Depths. This is an optional boss as players don't need to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring. Fia's Champions spawn in three waves: single invader, single invader, three invaders. Each wave begins after previous one is defeated. Defeating all five enemies grants you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia's+Mist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia's Mist</a> sorcery.<br /><br />
<b>Fia's Quest Conclusion:</b> Approach <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia</a> (sitting to the left of the waygate you approached to trigger the boss fight) and talk to her proceed with her quest. If you visited the Divine Tower of Liurnia in the previous step, you will have the option to hand over the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cursemark+of+Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cursemark of Death</a>. After you give it to her and exhaust her dialog, reload the area and talk/exhaust the dialogue one more time. Upon reloading the area once again, she'll be asleep at Godwyn's side. Inspecting her will let you enter Godwyn's dream to fight <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lichdragon+Fortissax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lichdragon Fortissax</a> and defeating it grants you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Lichdragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Lichdragon</a>. When you return from the dream, receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mending+Rune+of+the+Death-Prince" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mending Rune of the Death-Prince</a> from Fia to unlock an alternate ending, then reload the area again to loot her armor set, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia's Set</a>. If you gave <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/D's+Twin+Brother" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D's Twin Brother</a> the Twinned Set in Nokron, he'll appear by Fia after her quest ends. Exhaust his dialogue then reload the area to retrieve the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twinned+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twinned Set</a> and also receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Inseparable+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inseparable Sword</a>.<br /><br />

Begin from northwest Liurnia of the Lakes. Take the stairs to the very top of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Renna's+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renna's Rise</a> and take the waygate there. It will teleport you to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ainsel+River+Main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsel River Main</a>, that northern part of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ainsel+River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsel River</a> that was inaccessible last time you were there. Inside an open coffin you'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miniature+Ranni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miniature Ranni</a>. Hold on to that doll for now, you'll need it later. If you haven't been progressing Ranni's quest, the waygate at Renna's Rise will be inaccessible to you. Instead, you can take the coffin found at the edge of the waterfall in northwestern Deeproot Depths to get here. Interact with the Ainsel River Main site of grace and follow the path through the river, where you'll get to another section of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Uhl+Palace+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uhl Palace Ruins</a>. Clear the enemies out and collect the loot here that includes <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Gloveworts [6]</a> & <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone [4]</a>, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Nokstella, Eternal City Exploration:</b> Continue west and keep following the path up, making sure not to fall back down into the lower floors of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ainsel+River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsel River</a>, and eventually you'll reach <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nokstella,+Eternal+City" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nokstella, Eternal City</a>. Feel free to explore the city to collect equipment and valuable upgrade materials. Items of note are <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Archer+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archer Ashes</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nightmaiden+&+Swordstress+Puppets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nightmaiden & Swordstress Puppets</a>, and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost-Glovewort+Picker's+Bell+Bearing+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [2]</a>, all of which can be found in buildings near the entrance to Nokstella. There's also a the Moon of Nokstella, a Talisman that increases your memory slots found in the north-west of the city. After acquiring the Moon of Nokstella in the temple, there is an easy-to-miss side exit on the south side: follow the path downward and take the elevator to nab a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>. As you explore you'll also find two Larval Tears. The Golden Seed and Larval Tears are limited items for each playthrough, so make sure to find them.<br /><br />
<b>Baleful Shadow & Discarded Palace Key:</b> When you're done exploring, head to the far western side of Nokstella to find a lift that takes you back down to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ainsel+River+Main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsel River Main</a>. You'll find a Site of Grace here where when resting at, you'll be given the option to talk with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miniature+Ranni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miniature Ranni</a> doll. She'll ignore you the first two times, but keep at it and she'll eventually give in and ask you to defeat a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Baleful+Shadow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baleful Shadow</a>. You'll be able to find this enemy by first heading south and then following the river west, looking for a small opening south of the Nokstella Waterfall Basin site of grace. Defeat him and you'll be rewarded with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Discarded+Palace+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discarded Palace Key</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Lake of Rot:</b> Head south and find a building that houses a lift taking you down. This lift will take you to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lake+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake Rot</a>. At the water's edge, just slightly past the Site of Grace, you can loot a corpse that holds the Map fragment for the Lake of Rot, making navigation easier.<br /><br />
<b>Ranni's Quest Detour:</b> Now that you've got the map and a Site of Grace to teleport to, we're taking a quick detour for <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's</a> quest. Feel free to skip this part if you've chosen not to provide your services to her. Teleport back to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library. There is a small chest next to a bookshelf north-west of where Rennala is sitting that can be unlocked with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Discarded+Palace+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discarded Palace Key</a> that <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miniature+Ranni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miniature Ranni</a> handed over to you. Inside you'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's</a> ring, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Moon+Ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Moon Ring</a>. And with that out of the way, you can teleport back to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lake+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Rot</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Navigating Lake of Rot:</b> The waters here are treacherous, quickly applying the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scarlet+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Rot</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Status+Effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Status Effect</a> each second you stand in the water. It is recommended to have many <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Preserving+Boluses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preserving Boluses</a> on hand to remove the status effect immediately and even equip <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Talismans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talismans</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Armor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Armor</a> that can help alleviate its build up (focus on those that raise <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Immunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immunity</a>). Also, be aware that <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basilisks</a> may come out of the waters to ambush you.
<ul>
<li>Since Preserving Boluses can't be bought in large quantities and they require a rare item to craft, you may not want to use them at this point. The best option if you want to breeze through this lake is to use the incantation Flame Cleanse Me, which requires 12 faith. If you don't have the necessary faith you can equip the Two Fingers Heirloom that gives you +5 faith. Alternatively, you can also use a Rune Arc with Godrick's Great Rune equipped. Both of these together will you give +10 faith, which should make any class able to use Flame Cleanse Me.</li>
<li>If you don't have Flame Cleanse Me already, it can be found in one of the corpses at the Fire Monk camp, southeast of the Church of Vows (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=956&lat=-135.570312&lng=75.074406&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Link</a>). As an incantation, Flame Cleanse Me requires a Sacred Seal to cast. If you don't have one you can easily afford one at The Roundhold Table, in which the two mummies will sell it for a small amount of runes. As a final tip, it's also recommended to change your flask allocation to at least one or two mana flasks, so you can use Flame Cleanse Me more sparingly</li>
</ul>
If you look out into the lake, you may be able to see four pillars standing on their own small island in the distance. These small islands have buttons on them that raise land masses in the lake, giving you safe platforms to stand on while navigating through the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lake+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Rot</a>. The nearest pillar to you right now at the starting island should be to your south-west, and after that, the next one should be south of the first pillar. You may notice a familiar-looking boss in the middle of the lake. Ignore him for now and find the next two pillars to raise all the landmasses in the lake and make collection and boss fighting easier and much safer.<br /><br />
<b>Lake of Rot Boss & Loot:</b> With all the landmasses raised, we can go deal with the boss. In the middle of the lake, next to three raised islands, sits the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonkin+Soldier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonkin Soldier</a> once again. Defeat him, being careful not to get knocked down in the water. From here you can choose to loot bodies scattered all around <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lake+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Rot</a> to obtain <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Items" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">items</a>, many of which are <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stones [7]</a> & <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a>. An item of note is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Warrior's+Cookbook+(22)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook [22]</a> obtained from a lone chest in a large ruin in the south-western section of the map. There's also an enemy in the southwestern region, in one of the raised platforms, that drops the greatsword <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Alabaster+Lord's+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alabaster Lord's Sword</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Grand Cloister & Astel, Naturalborn of the Void:</b> After you're done with this area, head over to the southern section, where you'll find a waterfall. Climb down the stairs next to it to reach the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grand+Cloister" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Cloister</a>. If you're not planning to explore the area, head west and then south by a group of enemies, where you'll find an open coffin at the tip of the waterfall. Interact with the coffin to rest in it and a cutscene will play. If you open your map now, you will find yourself in an isolated area south of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lake+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Rot</a>. Through the mist door, you'll fight <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Astel,+Naturalborn+of+the+Void" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astel, Naturalborn of the Void</a>, and with his defeat, all the underground areas have been explored. Head north past his boss room to find a lift that takes you back to the surface at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deep+Ainsel+Well" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Ainsel Well</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Moonlight Altar & Ranni's Quest Conclusion:</b> Regardless of whether or not you fought <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintstone+Dragon+Adula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glintstone Dragon Adula</a> earlier near <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni's+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's Rise</a>, it'll appear here again at the entrance of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moonlight+Altar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonlight Altar</a>.

An illusory floor next to Imp Statue requiring a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a> leads to the treasure chest, but beware the nearby <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revenant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revenants</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wraith+Caller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wraith Callers</a>.

<b>Elden Ring Map: Altus Plateau Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1963&lat=-120.30469&lng=75.90301&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Altus Plateau Starting Point</a>. The Altus Plateau, northeast of Liurnia, is your next destination. There are two ways to access it: fight your way up through the cliffside dungeon at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruin-Strewn+Precipice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruin-Strewn Precipice</a> (the red-outlined hole on the map, accessed from northern canyon of Liurnia of the Lakes), or use the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dectus+Medallion+(Left)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left</a> and right halves of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dectus+Medallion+(Right)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dectus Medallion</a> at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grand+Lift+of+Dectus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Lift of Dectus</a>. If you don't have the right half of the medallion, it can be found in Caelid:
<ul>
<li>Fast travel to Dragonbarrow West site of grace (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonbarrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonbarrow</a>) and head east until you find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fort+Faroth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fort Faroth</a>.</li>
<li>Skip or kill all the enemies and the right half of the medallion will be inside a chest on the top.</li>
</ul>
Once you've found your first Site of Grace in Altus, head back to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roundtable Hold</a> to speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brother Corhyn</a>. He'll leave the Roundtable Hold and from here, his quest starts.<br /><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If you decide to take the Grand Lift to Atlus using the Dectus Medallions, you'll meet up with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rya the Scout</a>, who will offer to take you to Volcano Manor, but it's recommended to put this off until later. For now, activate the grace directly North of her, then you may obtain the two map fragments for Atlus before continuing down this guide.<br /><br />
<b>Ruin-Strewn Precipice Route:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruin-Strewn+Precipice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruin-Strewn Precipice</a> can be accessed through Ravine-Veiled Village. Entering from Ruin-Strewn Precipice may be preferable as you can obtain several crafting materials, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Heart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Heart</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> within it. If you don't have access yet to Ravine-Veiled Village:
<ul>
<li>Fast travel to Caria Manor (Royal Moongazing Grounds site of grace), exit the manor to the west, make a u-turn to the right so you end up heading east (grab the Behind Caria Manor site of grace as you go past).</li>
<li>Head south-east from the Behind Caria Manor site of grace to an outcropping of rock (visible on the map) that will allow you to cross to the other side of the ravine, north of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bellum+Church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bellum Church</a>.</li>
<li>Turn north (i.e. left after jumping off the rock outcropping), and follow the downhill slope into the ravine. You will see a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> in the middle of the ravine ahead after you reach the bottom.</li>
<li>Not far beyond the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> you find the Ravine-Veiled Village site of grace.</li>
<li>From here, you can find your way through to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruin-Strewn+Precipice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruin-Strewn Precipice</a>.</li>
</ul>
You will have to fight another version of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Magma+Wyrm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magma Wyrm</a> and afterwards, head up to the plateau and you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruler's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruler's Set</a> shortly after.<br /><br />
<b>Western Altus Plateau:</b> You are now at the Abandoned Coffin site of grace (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1138&lat=-101.343747&lng=69.075444&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see it on the map here</a>).

In the lake area you can find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sage's+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sage's Cave</a> in the northern part. Inside you'll be able to loot a a bunch of gear. There are many illusion walls in this cave. One of them hides an optional boss battle with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Necromancer+Garris" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Necromancer Garris</a> that drops the flail <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Family+Heads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Heads</a>. At the end of the cave, you can fight the boss <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knife+Assassin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Knife Assassin</a>, who will drop <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Concealing+Veil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concealing Veil</a>.

This location has a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a>, as well as the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound+Knight+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodhound Knight Set</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gelmir+Knight+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gelmir Knight Set</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound+Knight+Floh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodhound Knight Floh</a> spirit ashes and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mantis+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mantis Blade</a> curved sword. Once you complete the location, return to the entrance and explore north to continue. You will be ambushed by a pack of wolves and then arrive at a fortification defended by a Mad Pumpkin Head and some soldiers. The <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pulley+Bow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulley Bow</a> can be looted here, and you can opt to follow the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rainbow+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow Stones</a> glowing on the ground and if you dismount and get close to the edge, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patches</a> will knock you to the ground level near the entrance to Seethewater Cave, to prevent you accessing the Volcano Manor. The road south from the patches encounter takes you to the First Mt. Gelmir Campsite site of grace, that has a staircase leading you down to the dead-end road toward Corpse-Stench Shack.<br /><br />
<b>Fallingstar Beast & Road of Iniquity:</b> You should instead cross the beam leading to the other side of the canyon and begin making your way up the ladder behind a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grafted+Scion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafted Scion</a> mini-encounter. This next section is a series of ladders and optional drops to loot, with one of the rests having a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Merchant+Mt.+Gelmir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Merchant</a>. Once you finish climbing all the ladders, you will need to cross a bridge which takes you to the Ninth Mt. Gelmir Campsite site of grace. Jumping via the Spiritspring or climbing the ladder leads you to an encounter with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Full-Grown+Fallingstar+Beast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast</a> that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fallingstar+Beast+Jaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallingstar Beast Jaw</a>. West of the crater of the above boss encounter, there are some protruding rock formations that serve as a bridge to another landmass, where you will eventually find a map piece and the Road of Iniquity site of grace. You will be attacked by Marionette Soldiers when you cross, so watch out! You can loot a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> and kill an invisible Teardrop Scarab to obtain <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Through+and+Through" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Through and Through</a>. As you approach the pillar containing the map piece, there will be deadly <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Hand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingercreeper</a> enemies ready to ambush you, so it is recommended to go for the site of grace first. Go down the road toward the pillar and run past all the hands and map to rest at Road of Iniquity, then double-back and loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Mt.+Gelmir)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Mt. Gelmir)</a>. You now have revealed the zone and are ready to head into Volcano Manor. Start by heading west from the site of grace, which will lead to a curving uphill path that ends in an encounter with Marionette Soldiers and a Frenzied Troll. Optionally, you can head east from the Road of Iniquity site of grace to reach <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+(Mt.+Gelmir)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Erdtree (Mt. Gelmir)</a>, where you can battle an Ulcerated Tree Spirit for <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leaden+Hardtear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaden Hardtear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean+Hidden+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cerulean Hidden Tear</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Volcano Manor:</b> There are different ways to deal with the location, so see <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Volcano+Manor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volcano Manor</a> for details. The final Volcano Manor quest requires access to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mountaintops+of+the+Giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mountaintops of the Giants</a>. You can do the rest of the quests, as well as the dungeon, until then. Do note that all the Volcano Manor's NPC questlines, including Tanith's, should be completed before defeating <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rykard,+Lord+of+Blasphemy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy</a>, or you'll get locked out of rewards until NG+. There are a few NPC quests you want to keep a note of while there. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tanith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanith</a> gives you three requests on behalf of the Volcano Manor. Speak to Rya, Bernahl, and Diallos each time you return from completing one. After completing the first request, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patches</a> appears at the manor's entrance and gives you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Letter+to+Patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter to Patches</a> detailing a manor quest. Completing his quest for him nets you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bull-Goat+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bull-Goat Set</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Magma+Whip+Candlestick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magma Whip Candlestick</a>. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rya</a> will also move to a new room in the manor after the first request is complete. Speak to her in her new form, find the Prison Town Church Site of Grace and open the doors out, then return back to her to progress her quest. Speak to Tanith about Rya to get an optional item later on. After completing the second Volcano Manor request, speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knight+Bernahl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knight Bernahl</a> to receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Letter+to+Bernahl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter to Bernahl</a>. Help him with his manor quest and you'll be given the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raging+Wolf+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raging Wolf Set</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gelmir's+Fury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gelmir's Fury</a> sorcery. You'll also probably want to continue Rya's quest. In the Volcano Manor dungeon, retrieve the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Serpent's+Amnion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serpent's Amnion</a> after defeating the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godskin+Noble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godskin Noble</a>. Take it back to Rya and she'll leave her room, then speak to Tanith to receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tonic+of+Forgetfulness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tonic of Forgetfulness</a>. The tonic can be used for this quest, or another one later on. You'll find Rya within the dungeon, close to the Temple of Eiglay Site of Grace. Speak to her and from here, you have three options. If you do as she asks, she'll give you <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Daedicar's+Woe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daedicar's Woe</a>. If you give her the Tonic of Forgetfulness, she falls asleep and after defeating <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rykard,+Lord+of+Blasphemy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy</a>, you'll find her at her old spot in Volcano Manor's drawing room. Reload the area and she'll leave behind Daedicar's Woe. Finally, you can choose to do nothing. Defeat Rykard, then return to her and exhaust her dialogue. Reload the area to get <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Zoraya's+Letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoraya's Letter</a> and Daedicar's Woe. After completing the third Volcano Manor request, exhaust Diallos' dialogue and upon reloading the area, he will have left.<br /><br />
<b>Post-Manor Quest Updates:</b> After the events at the Volcano Manor, Patches can next be found in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/The+Shaded+Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaded Castle</a>, on the bridge leading up to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elemer+of+the+Briar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elemer's</a> boss room. Exhaust his dialogue to receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dancer's+Castanets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dancer's Castanets</a>. You can hand them over to Tanith, who will now be found in Rykard's boss room. When you're done with that, head back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jarburg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarburg</a> and speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jar+Bairn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jar Bairn</a>. He'll mention <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Diallos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diallos</a> is in town, so find him and exhaust his dialogue as well. Reload the area (you may have to do it a few times) or go exploring then come back to Jarburg. Jar Bairn and Diallos will have moved locations. Exhaust their dialogue then reload the area a final time and exhaust their dialogue again. Since you've interacted with Primeval Sorcerer Azul earlier, you can finish <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sorceress+Sellen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorceress Sellen's</a> questline. Do note that this requires a lot of backtracking to previous areas. After going back to speak to her, head to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sellia+Hideaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sellia Hideaway</a> to interact with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Master+Lusat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master Lusat</a>, then return and exhaust her dialogue again. Next, head to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Witchbane+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witchbane Ruins</a> and follow Sellen's instructions, then head to Seluvis' secret underground puppet room to use the item she gives you. Head back to Chamber Outside the Plaza Site of Grace and head north to meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Witch-Hunter+Jerren" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witch-Hunter Jerren</a>. Meet him back at the Witchbane Ruins then head to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library. Right outside the main gate, you'll be given a choice to help either Sellen or Jerren. If you help Sellen, exhaust her dialogue here at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raya+Lucaria+Academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raya Lucaria Academy</a>, then reload the area and she'll permanently stay here as a merchant. If you help Jerren, speak to him outside the library's entrance and exhaust his dialogue to receive your reward.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Leyndel Royal Capital Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=5762&lat=-100.79&lng=84.93&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Leyndel Royal Capital Starting Point</a>. There are two ways to access <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Royal+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell, Royal Capital</a>, but we will approach it from South to North in order to procure the map fragment as soon as possible. You will thus begin from the Altus Highway Junction site of grace, and take the large bridge up to the gates. Here you will have a duo of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tree Sentinel</a> bosses that drop the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Greatshield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdtree Greatshield</a>. They are optional, so you can run by and get to the Outer Wall Phantom Tree site of grace instead. Here you can collect 2x <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Leyndell,+Royal+Capital)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Leyndell, Royal Capital)</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Outer Wall - South Exploration:</b> From this site of grace, if you go south to a small military camp, you can fight a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Ulcerated+Tree+Spirit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit</a> that drops a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant-Crusher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant-Crusher</a> can be looted from a chest there. Further East, you will come to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+Church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Erdtree Church</a> and can loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Missionary%27s+Cookbook+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missionary's Cookbook (4)</a> as well as the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Order+Seal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Order Seal</a>. From here, we will travel north and slightly east and down into the watery area. On the southern point of it there's the "<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sealed+Tunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sealed Tunnel</a>", that requires you to hit an illusory wall to enter. The tunnel has secret areas to explore, so check out the Secret Tunnel page for details. Notable loot is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing-Stone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (2)</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (5)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(6)</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (6)</a> that you can find. The boss <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Onyx+Lord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onyx Lord</a> drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Onyx+Lord's+Greatsword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onyx Lord's Greatsword</a> as well. The point of this tunnel (besides the loot) is that it acts as a passageway to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Divine+Tower+of+West+Altus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine Tower of West Altus</a>, where you can activate <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rykard,+Lord+of+Blasphemy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rykard's Rune</a>. If you don't have it yet you will have to come back later.<br /><br />
<b>Outer Wall - North Exploration:</b> Return to the Outer Wall Phantom Tree site of grace and take the road North. You can opt to fight a Gargoyle or press forward until you see another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Palm+Reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palm Reader</a> of this area. A teardrop scarab nearby will drop you <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Golden+Parry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Golden Parry</a>. Take the road north-west from this point and listen for a familiar voice saying, "I see you, tarnished." This is Margitt, who will drop the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Viridian+Amber+Medallion+1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viridian Amber Medallion +1</a> if defeated. Press on along the road and activate the Outer Wall Battleground site of grace.<br /><br />
<b>Outer Wall - East & Minor Erdtree:</b> You will now want to turn eastward until you find a road heading further east. If you take a small detour north on this road, you can follow it on a u-turn to arrive at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hermit+Merchant's+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermit Merchant's Shack</a>. There's a merchant here as well as two nighttime invasions: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearing+Hunter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bell Bearing Hunter</a> (drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Medicine+Peddler's+Bell+Bearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicine Peddler's Bell Bearing</a>) and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathbird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathbird</a> (drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twinbird+Kite+Shield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twinbird Kite Shield</a>). From here, we'll take the road east and north. Don't go to the Minor Erdtree yet, as an altar at the top of the road has the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Winged+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winged Crystal Tear</a>. After collecting, visit the Minor Erdtree and loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twiggy+Cracked+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twiggy Cracked Tear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Crystal Tear</a>.<br /><br />
<b>The Moat & NPC Encounters:</b> Travel directly south until you see moat at the base of the wall. If you followed the instructions in Liurnia and talked to this merchant, you will now meet <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blackguard+Big+Boggart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blackguard Big Boggart</a>. You can now purchase <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Boiled+Crab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boiled Crab</a> from him. This moat will also have an invasion from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater</a> that we'll cover later on. If Boggart is here when Dung Eater is ready to invade, you'll get some extra dialogue from him. Reload the area and speak to him again, then reload the area a final time to pick up a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seedbed+Curse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seedbed Curse</a> (this particular Seedbed Curse is entirely optional and not required to finish the NPC quest it's a part of).<br /><br />
<b>Auriza's Tombs:</b> Follow the path east from here and the road will diverge north and south. To the South, you can take on <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Auriza+Hero's+Grave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auriza Hero's Grave</a> and loot several heavy armor and weapons. To the north, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Auriza+Side+Tomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auriza Side Tomb</a> has the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Soldjars+of+Fortune+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soldjars of Fortune Ashes</a> that summons "potboys" to fight alongside you as well as <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (5)</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(6)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort (6)</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Perfumer's+Cookbook+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perfumer's Cookbook (3)</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Draconic Tree Sentinel:</b> Turn back toward the Minor Erdtree and return to the main higher road. This time follow the higher path east until it turns into an open-field boss fight with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Draconic+Tree+Sentinel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draconic Tree Sentinel</a>. Defeating this boss will reward you with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Greatclaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Greatclaw</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonclaw+Shield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonclaw Shield</a> and access to the Legacy Dungeon of this area: Leyndell, Capital City.<br /><br />
<b>Leyndell, Royal Capital (Legacy Dungeon):</b> The path within the legacy dungeon is challenging so it's advisable that you upgrade everything you can and optimize your setup before heading in. A full walkthrough for the area is found here: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell+Royal+Capital+(Legacy+Dungeon)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell Royal Capital (Legacy Dungeon)</a>

<b>Boc's Quest Conclusion:</b> At the entrance to Leyndell, by the East Capital Rampart Site of Grace, you'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Boc+the+Seamster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boc</a>. This will be his final location until you're given a big choice in his quest. Hand over the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gold+Sewing+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Sewing Needle</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Tailoring+Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Tailoring Tools</a> to Boc. Exhaust his dialogue and stop after you've listened to the "Have you ever thought so?" dialogue. From here, you'll have two options. The first option is to give him a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Larval+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larval Tear</a> to help him be reborn. If you choose this option, he'll next be found next to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rennala,+Queen+of+the+Full+Moon+(NPC)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rennala</a> in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Academy+of+Raya+Lucaria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy of Raya Lucaria</a>. You can interact with him and upon reloading the area, you'll see the result of his rebirth. The second option is to continue his dialogue (don't give him the Larval Tear) and when you've exhausted it all, use the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prattling+Pate+You're+Beautiful" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prattling Pate "You're Beautiful"</a> next to him. Exhaust his dialogue again and he'll stay in this room.<br /><br />
<b>Corhyn & Goldmask's Quest:</b> While you're in Leyndell, make sure to grab the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Order+Principia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Order Principia</a> found close to the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace. You'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brother Corhyn</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Goldmask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldmask</a> up on a cliff next to the coliseum. Give the Golden Order Principa to Corhyn and learn the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Law+of+Regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Law of Regression</a> incanation. Exhaust Corhyn's dialogue about Goldmask then head back to the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace. Head west, take the lift down and then descend the stairs, and you'll find a white message left on the ground close to a statue of Radagon. Cast the Law of Regression while standing on the message, then read the new message that appears in front of it. Return to Goldmask to report your findings and exhaust Corhyn's dialogue.<br /><br />
<b>After Defeating Morgott:</b> After defeating <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Morgott+the+Omen+King" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgott the Omen King</a>, speak to him for some additional dialogue.

Exhaust all their dialogue and you'll be given an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> by Nepheli. In addition, Gostoc now sells one as well.<br /><br />
<b>Dung Eater's Quest:</b> When returning to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roundtable Hold</a> at any point after entering Leyndell, you'll be able to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater</a> as an invader in his own room. He doesn't attack but you can speak to him to start his quest. Speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roderika" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roderika</a> every time he returns to the Roundtable Hold to hear new dialogue.

<b>Subterranean Shunning-Grounds:</b> The <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Subterranean+Shunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranean Shunning-Grounds</a> can also be accessed from Leyndell, Royal Capital, but this area is covered much later in the guide as the enemies are quite tough and you can come across it naturally again later in your playthrough. However, parts of <a href="https-:"//eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hyetta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyetta's</a> quests take part in this area.

<b>Black Blade Kindred:</b> Before you gain access to the lift, you will face <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Blade+Kindred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Blade Kindred</a>, that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gargoyle's+Black+Axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gargoyle's Black Axe</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gargoyle's+Black+Blades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gargoyle's Black Blades</a>.<br /><br />

If you're doing the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Volcano+Manor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volcano Manor</a>/<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tanith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanith's</a> questline, remember to return there after completing the final part of that quest here in this region. Unlike other areas, you begin this zone with an easy one-way forward that leads you straight to the first map fragment <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+Mountaintops+of+the+Giants,+West" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map Mountaintops of the Giants, West</a>. Activate the site of grace and talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shabriri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shabriri</a> for some quick information. If you've already interacted with Three Fingers at this point, you'll just find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ronin's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronin's Set</a> where he should be. You should now explore <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Zamor+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zamor Ruins</a> and find the stairs leading down to a chest to get <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing-Stone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+[3]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [3]</a> as it will allow you to buy Smithing Stone (5) and (6) from the Roundtable hold. there's also <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Zamor+Ice+Storm+(Spell)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zamor Ice Storm (Spell)</a> that can be looted here.<br /><br />
<b>Western Mountaintops:</b> Follow the road east and north through a narrow passage that brings you about to a small landing with Fire Monk enemies. On the right side of the bridge, you can complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giants'+Mountaintop+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giants' Mountaintop Catacombs</a> (get <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glovewort+Picker's+Bell+Bearing+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [2]</a> from the boss as well as the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Monk+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire Monk Ashes</a>, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a> in the chest behind the boss fight). You can loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Briars+of+Punishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Briars of Punishment</a> before braving the narrow road north past an Archer Golem. Just Don't stop running and make good use of double-jump! You will arrive at Ancient Snow Valley Ruins, and notice there is plenty to explore in a higher level than you are. Travel the canyon floor north until you reach a frozen river with Guardian Golems, then head EAST and take your first right to loot a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>. Backtrack to the spot you first reached the river and now instead travel West past demi-humans and bats until you discover Shack of the Lofty. Here you can loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Traveling+Maiden+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traveling Maiden Set</a>, and fight Juno Hoslow if you're doing the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Volcano+Manor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volcano Manor</a> quests.<br /><br />
<b>Stargazer's Ruins & Minor Erdtree:</b> To the south of the shack, take the spirit spring to the higher ground and complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stargazer's+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stargazer's Ruins</a> by summoning the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Jellyfish+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jelly Fish Spirit Ashes</a>. You'll be rewarded with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Primal+Glintstone+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primal Glintstone Blade</a>. You should now also talk to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brother Corhyn</a> before crossing the narrow bridge south-east, looting a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (9)</a> and arriving at the region's Minor Erdtree. If you still have the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tonic+of+Forgetfulness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tonic of Forgetfulness</a> from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tanith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanith</a>, you have the option to give it to Corhyn here. Defeat the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdtree Avatar</a> and loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Bubbletear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Bubbletear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cerulean Crystal Tear</a> before taking the northern bridge to cross over to the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook site of grace.<br /><br />
<b>Freezing Lake & Heretical Rise:</b> From here we will travel East and through the graveyard until we reach the Freezing Lake site of grace, located just to the right before the frozen lake. Now take a careful look upwards to the south-west of the site of grace. To the left, you'll notice a tower structure at the top of the cliffs, and to the right, a small piece of a broken bridge pointing towards the tower. Make your way back up the cliffs to the bridge, where you'll find some skeletal archers. Behind them, there's an invisible path off the ledge of the broken bridge, leading up to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Heretical+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heretical Rise</a>. Use your torch or online bloodstains/messages to chart your way through the invisible bridge and you can obtain <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Founding+Rain+of+Stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Founding Rain of Stars</a> from within the tower (beware, there are enemies inside that will ambush you when entering). When finished with this area, you will now travel south and down the eastern slopes to the Frozen lake that is engulfed in a snowstorm (it will remain that way until you defeat <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Borealis+the+Freezing+Fog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borealis the Freezing Fog</a>). The very south-east of the lake has a site of grace and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/First+Church+of+Marika" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Church of Marika</a>, so it's advisable to visit there first to get a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Tear</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somberstone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (3)</a>. You can take on the dragon or not, and if you explore the mid-west section of the lake you can enter the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spiritcaller+Cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiritcaller Cave</a> for a rather annoying Boss Fight with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godskin+Apostle+&+Godskin+Noble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble</a> that yields the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Flame+Ritual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Flame Ritual</a> incantation. The cave also has the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Reed+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Reed Set</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godskin+Swaddling+Cloth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godskin Swaddling Cloth</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Eastern Mountaintops & Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave:</b> Once you are done with the lake, head south on the road leading down from Heretical Rise to unlock <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=2803&lat=-73.640625&lng=163.12142&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whiteridge Road site of grace</a>. You can opt to do the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lord+Contender's+Evergaol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord Contender's Evergaol</a> nearby or press on to complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Guardian's+Garrison" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian's Garrison</a> to loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant's+Prayerbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant's Prayerbook</a>. From this point, you will cross a frozen chain to the south-eastern area of the region, where you'll find the Giant's Gravepost site of grace and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Mountaintops+of+The+Giants,+East)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Mountaintops of The Giants, East)</a>. The area that follows has some challenging enemies with high reach, so feel free to ride by to expedite your progress. Your first step will be to follow the cliff edge and go west until you spot an opportunity for a narrow jump across a gap that lands you above the starting point of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Zamor+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zamor Ruins</a>.. The <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant-Conquering+Hero's+Grave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave</a> here has a true wealth of high level ash materials (Grave Glovewort 7, 8 and 9!), as well as <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant's+Seal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant's Seal</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flame,+Protect+Me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flame, Protect Me</a>. Come with 2 Stone Sword Key to unlock everything. The boss is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Hero+of+Zamor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Hero of Zamor</a> and will drop the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Zamor+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zamor Set</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Zamor+Curved+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zamor Curved Sword</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Church of Repose & Fire Giant:</b> Teleport back to Giant's Gravepost and this time take the south road toward <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Repose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of Repose</a>. You will be invaded by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloody+Finger+Okina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okina</a> before arriving, so be ready with some hemorrhage resistance and get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Okina+Mask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okina Mask</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rivers+of+Blood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rivers of Blood</a> katana after defeating him. The church has a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Tear</a> to loot, and looking toward the south-east cliffs from the church, you'll see a massive cliff-skull. In the mouth of this skull you will find an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>, and on top of the skull (reachable by a spirit spring found behind the cliffs) the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Troll's+Roar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Troll's Roar</a>. From the church, follow the eastern cliffs and go north, unlocking the Foot of the Forge site of grace. Across the chain is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Giant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire Giant</a> boss fight, but before you engage you should travel north to loot a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>, and nearby the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimsonwhorl+Bubbletear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimsonwhorl Bubbletear</a> (that converts damage received into HP) can be found. Visit the page for an in-depth description on how to find it.<br /><br />
<b>Castle Sol & Commander Niall:</b> We will now take a detour to complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Sol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castle Sol</a>, that we left unattended as the boss battle can be rather challenging, and this loop gave you an opportunity to loot upgrade materials and level up. Return to the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook and wait until nightfall. Far to the west from this point (north of the Shack of the Lofty, as seen on the map) <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Rite+Bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Rite Bird</a> will invade – that on defeat drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Ritual+Spear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Ritual Spear</a>. From here, travel north and east toward the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Walking+Mausoleum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walking Mausoleum</a> of the area. Unlock the site of grace, then explore to defeat a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tibia+Mariner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibia Mariner</a> and get a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a> before entering the Castle. If you spoke to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Latenna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latenna</a> earlier, she'll let you know when you're approaching Castle Sol. See the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Sol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castle Sol</a> page for a detailed walkthrough of the area. You will have to challenge <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Commander+Niall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commander Niall</a> to obtain the important item: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligtree+Secret+Medallion+(Left)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haligtree Secret Medallion (Left)</a>.<br /><br />
Once you have done this, you have a choice:
<ol>
<li>Return to Foot of the Forge and Defeat Fire Giant, then backtrack to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Consecrated+Snowfield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consecrated Snowfield</a> secret location</li>
<li>Ignore Foot of the Forge and Fire Giant, backtrack to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Consecrated+Snowfield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consecrated Snowfield</a> secret location</li>
<li>Return to Foot of the Forge and Defeat Fire Giant, proceed to Fire Forge and be automatically teleported to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crumbling Farum Azula</a></li>
</ol>
For this walkthrough, we will pick 1 or 2 - the reason is that Consecrated Snowfield is a sub-region of mountaintop and the auto-teleport to Azula will result in a final auto-teleport to endgame later. So doing Snowfield first keeps the story flow better.<br /><br />

You don't have to complete this location to continue, but it's advisable to ensure you get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (9)</a> in the area as well as the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blackflame+Monk+Amon+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blackflame Monk Amon Ashes</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Scarab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Scarab</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spelldrake+Talisman+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spelldrake Talisman +2</a> loot before moving on.<br /><br />
<b>Snowfield Exploration & Catacombs:</b> Once out, you will be in an area overcome by a snowstorm and with very poor visibility. Latenna will speak up and let you know how to get to Apostate Derelict. But before that, you should head due north to unlock the first site of grace of the area, and continue on that same path along the barely visible road to collect <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Warrior's+Cookbook+(23)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (23)</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>. If you opt to stick to your right (east) and go north as you come out of the hidden path catacombs, you will find a teardrop scarab that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (8)</a> somewhere near the cookbook location. Continue hugging this cliff and proceed further into the storm until you arrive at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Consecrated+Snowfield+Catacombs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs</a>. This location is highly recommended as it has a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Grave+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Grave Glovewort</a> as a reward for defeating the boss, alongside some <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (8)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (9)</a>. These materials are very useful for the challenging endgame ahead. You can also get several consumables and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Gravekeeper+Cloak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Gravekeeper Cloak</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp+Head+(Elder)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imp Head (Elder)</a> inside this mini-dungeon.<br /><br />
<b>Caravans & Night's Cavalry:</b> Exit the catacombs and go west into the storm. You will find a traveling caravan of enemies that drops <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/St+Trina's+Torch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St Trina's Torch</a>. Continue west from here, slightly south-west from the Inner Consecrated Snowfield site of grace and there will be another caravan, this time with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flowing+Curved+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flowing Curved Sword</a> in its chest. If you visit this location at night, you will face a double boss of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Cavalry</a> that drop the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Night's+Cavalry+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night's Cavalry Set</a> and an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Yelough Anix Ruins & Tunnel:</b> West from here, you can grab the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stalwart+Horn+Charm+1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stalwart Horn Charm +1</a> talisman before keep heading west into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yelough+Anix+Ruins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelough Anix Ruins</a> to collect the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Unendurable+Frenzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unendurable Frenzy</a> incantation. Nearby, to the south you should explore and complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Yelough+Anix+Tunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelough Anix Tunnel</a> as it provides with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (8)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (9)</a>, an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Meteorite+of+Astel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meteorite of Astel</a> gravity sorcerer via the boss: <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Astel,+Stars+of+Darkness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astel, Stars of Darkness</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Mohgwyn Palace Teleporter:</b> Exit the tunnel and head north along the edge of the cliffs, past the hooded trolls in the ruins, and you will come to an area with Rune Bears and an invasion by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sanguine+Noble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sanguine Noble</a> that drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sanguine+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sanguine Set</a>. A stone's throw north-west of this location (from the large tree with reddish foliage around it) you'll find a special gateway with some blood, which is the teleporter point to the underground Mohgwyn Palace. Make a note of the location (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3170&lat=-70.68&lng=129.59&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=3170&lat=-70.68&lng=129.59&code=mapA</a>) as we will come back here later!<br /><br />
<b>Albinauric Rise & Minor Erdtree:</b> Return to the Inner Consecrated Snowfield site of grace (<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4578&lat=-73.563&lng=141.781&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). To the east, on the cliffs overlooking the frozen river, you can find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintstone+Craftsman's+Cookbook+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glintstone Craftsman's Cookbook (8)</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Albinauric+Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albinauric Rise</a> tower that requires you to summon <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fanged+Imp+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fanged Imp Ashes</a> to unlock the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Graven-Mass+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graven-Mass Talisman</a>. Further east from here, you will be attacked by a pack of wolves and have the option to take a gateway to access the Minor Erdtree. Defeat the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrid Avatar</a> guarding it to loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruptured+Crystal+Tear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruptured Crystal Tear</a>, then follow the road sloping down and west.<br /><br />
<b>Ordina, Liturgical Town:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ordina+Liturgical+Town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ordina Liturgical Town</a> comes into view, and you can get close and activate the site of grace if you want. We won't the do the town yet, so head slightly south and collect the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> of the area, before riding all the way to the frozen lake to find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Consecrated+Snowfield)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Consecrated Snowfield)</a>. If you follow the frozen river all the way east to the waterfall, you will be able to loot <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> and explore the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cave+of+the+Forlorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cave of the Forlorn</a> to obtain <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Heart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Heart</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (7)</a> alongsinde the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Order+Greatsword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Order Greatsword</a>. This is an optional location and unnecessary if you aren't looking to 100%.<br /><br />
<b>Apostate Derelict & Latenna's Quest:</b> Return to the Ordina site of grace but don't go into the town yet. Instead do a loop around it so you can loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Knife+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Knife Set</a> from under an archway on the northern outskirts of the town. West from here you can challenge a duelist to obtain <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Greataxe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Greataxe</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Duelist+Greaves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Duelist Greaves</a> if you were hoping to complete that set. Your objective now is to get to the base of the river and follow it north, as this will allow you to bypass the attacks of the Walking Mausoleum. At the very end of the river, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Rite+Bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Rite Bird</a> spawns at night that will drop you <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Explosive+Ghostflame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explosive Ghostflame</a>. From that dead-end, find a narrow path along the cliffs heading north and west, and follow them upward using the cliff as a guard for the mausoleum attacks. Ride into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Apostate+Derelict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apostate Derelict</a> and loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Mirrorshield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Mirrorshield</a> within. You'll be given a prompt to summon <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Latenna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latenna</a> here. After you speak to her and exhaust her dialogue, her quest is done. Leave the Apostate Derelict then deal with the mausoleum outside.<br /><br />
You should now go and complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohgwyn+Palace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohgwyn Palace</a> from the gateway we found earlier, as Ordina, Liturgical Town unlocks the path to a VERY challenging endgame dungeon you won't want to do yet.<br /><br />
<b>Ordina, Liturgical Town Puzzle:</b> If you prefer, head into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ordina,+Liturgical+town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ordina, Liturgical town</a> and activate the evergaol system there to enter an instanced event. This is an INCREDIBLY annoying area as there are invisible enemies that will attack you relentlessly, plus archers that can see you from very far away. Your objective is to light 4 candles:
<ol>
<li>Candle #1 is in the central square - beware though that you will most certainly be attacked by a shadow assassin. All other candles can be reached without the shadow assassin attacking you.</li>
<li>Candle #2 is at the far west edge of the town, and there's a ladder up to it blending in with the stones. From the starting point turn right and jump over the balcony, turn left and go around the town until you reach the ladder.</li>
<li>Candle #3 From the starting point, jump over the balcony to the south. Continue south and at the stairs, jump on the upper railing and onto the balcony on the left side of the stairs. There is a ladder to your direct left, next to a door. Climb the next ladder right in front of you and you will reach candle 3.</li>
<li>Candle #4 This is probably the hardest Candle due to the archers. If you have Loretta's Greatbow or any other bow, first climb the stairs leading to the seal you try to open. From there you can get a shot on the archer on the right. If you're lucky you can finish him off right there or he'll jump to the other side of the roof. Now climb the same ladder you used to get to #3 and if the archer's still alive, finish him off from that corner. Now it's simple, follow the roof tops to where that archer was, climb the tower and light the final candle.</li>
</ol>
Once you have activated all the candles, you will leave the instance and the northern wall magic block at the top of the northern staircase will be gone. You can use that gateway to access <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Haligtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquella's Haligtree</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Mohgwyn Palace Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4614&lat=-184.901562&lng=154.502017&code=mapB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Mohgwyn Palace Starting Point</a>. If you've been following <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/White-Faced+Varre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varre's</a> quest, you may have already been given the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pureblood+Knight's+Medal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pureblood Knight's Medal</a>, which allows you to teleport to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohgwyn+Palace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohgwyn Palace</a> earlier. It's not recommended to use it early on in your playthrough however, as the area is filled with many tough enemies. You should be strong enough to tackle the area once you've reached <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Consecrated+Snowfield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consecrated Snowfield</a>. When taking the waygate in Consecrated Snowfield, you'll get teleported to a set of caves southeast of Mohgwyn Palace. The caves here are linear, so simply follow the path out and down and you'll be able to get to the Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace. Make your way north-west, where the slope is littered with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Albinauric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albinaurics</a>, and make sure to grab the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (6)</a> on the way down. At the bottom, you'll emerge into the main blood lake of Mohgwyn Palace.<br /><br />
<b>Map Fragment & Lake Exploration:</b> If you'd like to grab the map fragment before exploring the area, keep heading north-northwest until you get to a section with three hunting horn-wielding Albinaurics who can summon large spectral skeletons. Defeating them is much safer, but it is possible to run away from them. Once you get past them, head west to find a ruin, and the single corpse sitting in the middle here has the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Mohgwyn+Palace)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Mohgwyn Palace)</a>. If you've used the Pureblood Knight's Medal to teleport to Mohgwyn Palace, you'll be placed right at the entrance to this ruin. Head up the stairs to quickly grab the Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Site of Grace. With your newfound map, running around is much easier. If you take a look it, you'll see that a majority of the eastern side of Mohgwyn Palace is this blood-red lake. While you explore the lake area, you'll be invaded by three <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nameless+White+Mask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nameless White Masks</a>, each at different areas of the lake. Defeating these NPC invaders nets you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/War+Surgeon+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">War Surgeon Set</a>. In the southern section of the lake, you'll be able to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligdrake+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haligdrake Talisman</a> (+2), a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nomadic+Warrior's+Cookbook+(24)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (24)</a>. In the northern section of the lake, as well as the caves that line the eastern wall here, you'll be able to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Blood+Tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Blood Tax</a>, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Swarm+of+Flies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swarm of Flies</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantation</a>, and multiple valuable upgrade materials.<br /><br />
<b>Dynasty Mausoleum:</b> Make your way back to the Dynasty Mausoleum Site of Grace and head up the stairs in the southwest. In this area you'll be encountering a bunch of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Corpse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrid Corpses</a>. Many of them are fairly docile, not minding even a shoulder bump, while some will run at you and attempt to explode in your face. Whether you decide to take them out or leave them alone, follow the linear path here, grabbing a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (7)</a>, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Numen's+Rune" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numen's Rune</a>, and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a> on your way. You'll eventually get to a group of Putrid Corpses praising the sky in front of a dark doorway. This doorway leads into a very dark cave, so get your lantern or torch ready. At various points while exploring the cave, you'll get ambushed by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sanguine+Noble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sanguine Nobles</a>. If you die to them, you can respawn at the Stake of Marika right outside the cave's doorway. If you've done <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/White-Faced+Varre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varre's</a> quests so far, an invasion sign to invade his world appears right by the doorway. If you choose to invade him, you'll find him later at the end of the cave. At the first cave split you encounter, a Sanguine Noble will appear. Head down the south split before heading north to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imprisoned+Merchant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imprisoned Merchant</a>. When you head north, you'll immediately find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lord's+Rune" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord's Rune</a> in front of you. Continue northeast to get to a ledge overlooking a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Ghost Glovewort</a>. If you shine you torch down, you'll see a hoard of Putrid Corpses gathering around it. None of them in particular are the 'explode in your face' kind, so you can simply run past them to grab the glovewort. Next, head west, where you'll encounter another Sanguine Noble and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a> among some gravestones. Continue following the path, picking up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort (9)</a> on the way, and you'll eventually emerge outside to the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint Site of Grace. If you invaded Varre, he'll be found in the corridor right before you reach the midpoint Site of Grace. Exhaust his dialogue to get six <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Festering+Bloody+Finger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Festering Bloody Fingers</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Varre's+Bouquet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varre's Bouquet</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Path to the Boss:</b> Right ahead are a group of Albinaurics and a Sanguine Noble facing up towards a large statue. Take them out one by one and right in front of the statue is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> you can grab. If you take a peek on the lower ledge behind the statue, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a>. Turn around, facing northwest, and take the lift ahead up to a large ruined temple. When you walk in, a cutscene plays and the fight against <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+Lord+of+Blood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a> commences. Defeat him and you'll be rewarded with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Blood+Lord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Blood Lord</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg's+Great+Rune" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohg's Great Rune</a>. The Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace spawns here after his defeat as well.<br /><br />

While it is possible (and slightly easier) to complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crumbling Farum Azula</a> at this point, completing that Legacy Dungeon causes several changes in the world and gives you access to an endgame area, making the completion of that dungeon flow much better later on. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Game+Progress+Route#CrumblingFarumAzula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> if you'd like to tackle Crumbling Farum Azula before Miquella's Haligtree.<br /><br />
<b>Haligtree Canopy:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Haligtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquella's Haligtree</a> is split into two main parts, the tree canopy area and the walled structure within the Haligtree, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elphael,+Brace+of+the+Haligtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree</a>. You can find details on each of these sections on their respective pages. After you get transported to the tree's canopy from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ordina+Liturgical+Town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ordina, Liturgical Town</a>, the way forward is mostly north-eastward. There are a bunch of branching paths here that make navigation difficult, but exploring them may be worth it as you can find interesting loot such as two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Keys</a>, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Prattling+Pate+My+Beloved" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prattling Pate "My Beloved"</a>, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Envoy+Crown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envoy Crown</a>, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Ashes+of+War" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost Ashes of War</a>, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oracle+Envoy+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Envoy Ashes</a>. Be careful of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Oracle+Envoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Envoys</a> here however, as they have hard hitting, long-ranged, homing attacks.<br /><br />
<b>Haligtree Town:</b> Once you've gotten past the giant Oracle Envoy and headed down a ladder on the left side of a wide tree branch, you'll reach the Haligree Town Site of Grace. From here, the way forward is more obvious and the enemies less deadly. Start heading down the stairs and before going down the final flight of stairs, head up the ladder on the left to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pearldrake+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pearldrake Talisman</a> (+2). Continue forward, past am axe-wielding <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Misbegotten" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misbegotten</a> keeping watch over a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a>, past two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Poison+Flower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Poison Flowers</a>, past a large Misbegotten guarding an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>, and you'll eventually get to the Haligtree Town Plaza Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Haligtree Town Plaza:</b> From the Haligtree Town Plaza Site of Grace, head south to reach some roofs occupied by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Spirit-Caller+Snail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Spirit-Caller Snails</a>. If you look down and to your right, you'll find a building roof you can jump down to, and following the path here leads you to a chest with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Viridian+Amber+Medallion+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viridian Amber Medallion +2</a>. You'll find the way forward if you continue heading south and jumping down to the next platform. Up the ladder is a hoard of mushroom infested zombies. Continue going forward by heading down the ladder on the eastern side and then going through the building again in the east. You'll get to a bunch of bridges connecting to a single gazebo guarded by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Battlemage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlemages</a>. Defeat the Battlemages to pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (7)</a> & <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(8)</a> from the corpses here and by crossing one of the bridges here, you can activate a shortcut that leads back to the Haligtree Town Site of Grace. Head across another one of these bridges to reach a large promenade. When you enter, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Loretta,+Knight+of+the+Haligtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree</a> spawns at the far side and defeating her nets you <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Loretta's+Mastery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loretta's Mastery</a>, and her weapon, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Loretta's+War+Sickle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loretta's War Sickle</a>. Interact with the Haligtree Promenade Site of Grace and continue north down a flight of stairs. Before you enter the room with the elevator, head up the stairs to find an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. Backtrack back to the elevator and it'll take you down to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elphael,+Brace+of+the+Haligtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree:</b> Elphael is the the second part of the Miquella's Haligtree Legacy Dungeon and features a different set of enemies and different scenery. Cross the bridge guarded by a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cleanrot+Knight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleanrot Knight</a> and you'll reach the Prayer Room Site of Grace. You'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Millicent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millicent</a> here after speaking to her in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dominula,+Windmill+Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominula, Windmill Village</a>. Exhaust her dialogue, then continue forward in Elphael. There are multiple paths you can take here to continue moving forward so explore to your heart's content. Items of note are the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Marika's+Soreseal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marika's Soreseal</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Triple+Rings+of+Light" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple Rings of Light</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantation</a>, each locked behind their own imp statue, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquellan+Knight's+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquellan Knight's Sword</a> just below the bell in the center bell tower, and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligtree+Soldier+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haligtree Soldier Ashes</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cleanrot+Knight+Finlay+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleanrot Knight Finlay Ashes</a>, & two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seedbed+Curse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seedbed Curses</a> each further into the castle walls from the Prayer Room Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Path to Malenia:</b> No matter which route you take, you'll eventually get to an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdtree Avatar</a> in a courtyard overlooked by multiple ballistae. Defeat the Erdree Avater and you'll be able to interact with the Elphael Inner Wall Site of Grace behind it. When you head through the doorway down the steps, on your left is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Crystal+Sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Crystal Sword</a> in a chest behind the tree roots. Turn right instead to continue forward and climb up the tree root ahead to get through an opening in the wall. This opens up to a cliffside with a waterfall. The water here inflicts scarlet rot, similar to the water in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lake+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Rot</a>, and in the area you'll find several <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Kindred+of+Rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Kindreds of Rot</a> skulking around. The path here is quite linear so make your way to the cliff on the other side of the water and you'll be able to either continue up the hill or through a doorway to the right. You may want to head through the doorway first, as following the path takes you to the Drainage Channel Site of Grace, and the next part will be challenging.<br /><br />
<b>Millicent's Quest Conclusion:</b> If you continue up the hill and cross the tree roots, you'll get to a large secluded lake. In the middle is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Ghost Glovewort</a>, and when you go to pick it up, an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Ulcerated+Tree+Spirit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit</a> will ambush you from the water. Defeat it for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a>. If you're doing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Millicent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millicent's</a> questline, you'll also be able to finish her questline here by either interacting with the summon sign that lets you assist her in defeating her invaders, or betraying her and invading her yourself. Depending on the choice you've made, you will either receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Winged+Sword+Insignia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Winged Sword Insignia</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Unalloyed+Gold+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unalloyed Gold Needle</a>, or <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Millicent's+Prosthesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millicent's Prosthesis</a>. If you've interacted with the Three Fingers and want to remove the Frenzied Flame, make sure to assist her. You can also return to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gowry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gowry</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gowry's+Shack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gowry's Shack</a> to hear new dialogue. What you find in his shack differs depending on whether you betray or help Millicent.<br /><br />
<b>Boss Fight: Malenia, Blade of Miquella:</b> Back at the Drainage Channel Site of Grace, follow the tree roots and support beams outside to get to a roof with a hole in it. Jump down into the building and to your west is a balcony with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragoncrest+Greatshield+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman</a>. Jump down to the lowest floor, and if you want to explore the courtyard for various levels of Ghost Gloveworts and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost-Glovewort+Picker's+Bell+Bearing+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing (3)</a>, head out through the eastern door. Otherwise, head through the southwestern door to get to a lift taking you down. Immediately to your left (southeast) is a room with a large scarlet flower and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Melina's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melina's Set</a>. Head up the stairs here to activate the shortcut at the bell tower then head back out the room to interact with the Haligtree Roots Site of Grace. Head into the fog door in front of you to challenge <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Malenia,+Blade+of+Miquella" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malenia, Blade of Miquella</a>. This is a difficult boss fight, so feel free to check her page on tips and strategies on how to defeat her more easily. Defeat her to receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Rot+Goddess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Rot Goddess</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Malenia's+Great+Rune" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malenia's Great Rune</a>. Interact with the Malenia, Goddess of Rot Site of Grace that spawns after her defeat, and with that, Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree, and by extension Miquella's Haligtree, is done.<br /><br />
<b>Removing the Frenzied Flame:</b> If you want to remove the Frenzied Flame, reload Malenia's boss arena and return the Unalloyed Gold Needle to the Scarlet Aeonia to recieve <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquella's Needle</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Dung Eater's Quest Conclusion:</b> At this point if you've already met him, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater's</a> questline can be finished. Return to him at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Subterranean+Shunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranean Shunning-Grounds</a> and give him the five <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seedbed+Curse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seedbed Curses</a> you've found to receive the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse, unlocking another alternate ending. If you reload the area, you'll find his armor set, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Omen+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omen Set</a>, on him. You'll be given the option to give him <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seluvis's+Potion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seluvis's Potion</a> if you still have it at this point. Do note that giving it to him prevents you from getting the mending rune.<br /><br />

If you haven't done so already, head to the Foot of the Forge Site of Grace to fight the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Giant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire Giant</a>. You can summon <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Fist Alexander</a> to aid you and get additional dialogue when you next meet him. Upon defeat, the Giant drops the the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Fire+Giant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Fire Giant</a>. Head east up the mountain and up the chain to get to the Forge of the Giants Site of Grace. Interact with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Melina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melina</a> here to teleport to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crumbling Farum Azula</a>. If you've interacted with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Three+Fingers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three Fingers</a> at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Subterranean+Shunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranean Shunning-Grounds</a>, you have to select the 'Listen to the sound of flames' option at the Site of Grace instead. This <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Legacy+Dungeons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legacy Dungeon</a> is quite big and it's easy to get lost. For details on item locations and how to navigate through the area, see <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crumbling Farum Azula Walkthrough</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Crumbling Beast Grave:</b> When you get to Crumbling Farum Azula, cross the bridge, and at the end, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a>. Turn right and follow the path down. You'll get to a platform overlooking some Azula Beastmen and a building up ahead. When you get inside the building, head into the first doorway to your left to interact with the Crumbling Beast Grave Site of Grace. Head back out the room and at the end of the hallway, you'll be back outside with a makeshift bridge in front of you. When you get to about halfway through, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Farum+Azula+Dragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farum Azula Dragon</a> swoops down to try to attack you. It takes a while for it to attack you however, and you can easily run past it to get to the Crumbling Beast Grave Depths Site of Grace on the other side. On your way here, you can pick up a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (6)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Tempest-Facing Balcony:</b> In the next room, you'll find two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Azula+Beastman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azula Beastmen</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (7)</a> on one of the altars. You can continue through the northwestern hallway to reach a larger room, or you can take a detour by going through the windows in the southwest. Just after stepping out the windows, look to your right to see a rooftop that you can jump up to. Climbing up this rooftop will give you access to a higher floor in the building, where you can collect a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (6)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Grave+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Grave Glovewort</a> after defeating some more Azula Beastmen. Jumping down through the holes of this higher floor will bring you back to the larger room from earlier, or you can retrace your steps and go through the northwestern hallway to reach the same room. After dealing with the Azula Beastmen in this room, collect the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Prayerbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Prayerbook</a> on the floor. Immediately out the door to the northeast is the Tempest-Facing Balcony Site of Grace and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somberstone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (4)</a>. If you want some extra loot, head back into the building and out the southwestern door. To the right of the stairs going down is a corpse hidden by some pots, which you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hero's+Rune+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hero's Rune (2)</a> on. At the base of the stairs, you'll find a lift taking you down to an area infested with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Wormface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Wormface</a>. The path here circles 'round back to the lift, so there's no worries about getting lost just yet. In the lake area here, you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glovewort+Picker's+Bell+Bearing+(3)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing (3)</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a>. On your way back up to the lift, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a> on some arch ruins accessed by climbing up a ladder, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (9)</a> on the ground next to some Lesser Wormface. Once you're done, head back to the Temple-Facing Balcony Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Dragon Temple:</b> Head down the floating rocks and ruins west, where you'll get to a large floating ruin chunk occupied by <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Skeleton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeletons</a> that resemble Azula Beastmen. Grab the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (7)</a> here, then jump down north to the next large ruin chunk. Jump down into the hole in the corner of this chunk (should be immediately to your right when you land on it) and head northeast. Through the second door to your left is an item protected by a Skeleton, but the way forward is through the first doorway to your left. Follow the path, head up the ladder when you get to it, and then you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ghost+Glovewort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Ghost Glovewort</a> on the altar ahead. Three skeletal beastmen spawn behind you after you pick it up. Head out of the room and look down to your left to find a safe path back down to the large chunk of ruin with the hole you went down earlier. Continue north, picking up a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (9)</a> on the way, and you'll eventually find the Dragon Temple Site of Grace. From this Site of Grace, if you turn back around from where you came from, you'll see a set of stairs you can jump down to. At the base of these stairs, turn around again and head into the building to grab the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Azula+Beastman+Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azula Beastman Ashes</a>. When that's done, teleport back to the Dragon Temple Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Godskin Duo:</b> The structure ahead is the Dragon Temple. Be careful of the knights that wander its halls as they are formidable foes. Head through the temple's doorway then turn right. You'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (6)</a> at the end. Turn left and head down the stairs, then take a right again when you get to the hallway. Before going down the steps, turn left into another hallway to find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonesword Key</a>. If you continue down this path, you'll be able to find two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonwound+Grease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonwound Grease</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Rune+(12)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Rune (12)</a>. If these items don't interest you, backtrack back to the stairs and head down to get to the main hall. You'd have ended up in this room no matter which route you took. In this large room, you'll fight the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godskin+Duo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godskin Duo</a>, and upon their defeat will receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing-Stone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (4)</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Black+Flame+Tornado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash of War: Black Flame Tornado</a>. The Dragon Temple Altar Site of Grace spawns here too and you can now continue further into Crumbling Farum Azula.<br /><br />
<b>Dragon Temple Lift & Alexander's Quest:</b> If you head out the southeastern door you'll find the Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace. The way forward is out the northeastern door instead. Jump down to the lower platform in front of you with Azula Beastmen, then head left down the stairs. When you emerge back outside, you'll find some ruin windows to your left. If you've got any ranged abilities, it is recommended to snipe the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Stray" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Strays</a> and Azula Beastman here from afar as they can easily swarm you. Head through the window and be sure to check behind the ruin walls for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hero's+Rune+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hero's Rune (5)</a>. Jump down the ruins to the north and continue forward, taking note of the doorway on your right at the end of the hallway. Back outside, check behind the pillar in front of you for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (7)</a> then head up the stairs to your right. At the top of the stairs, turn left and you'll find a a column that is floating diagonally, close enough for you to jump on and climb up. Up here, you'll find an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> guarded by a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Stray" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Stray</a>. Backtrack back to the top of the stairs and head west, where there will be a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (9)</a> and imp statue in the area. The imp statue here locks off a large, but completely optional area. If you unlock it, you can take the lift behind it to the Dragon Temple Lift Site of Grace. The area past this Site of Grace is worth exploring as there is a lot of valuable loot to be found. Turn left after going out the doorway from the Site of Grace to get to a courtyard full of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Skeleton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeletons</a>. In the fountain in the middle is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lord's+Rune" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord's Rune</a>. Continue forward, sticking to the right side of the courtyard, and you'll get to an elevated platform with even more Skeletons. On the east side of the platform is a corpse laying by the edge of the cliff that has a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a>. Head westward next to find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> close to each other. Continue southwest, down the slope, and you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Teardrop+Scarab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teardrop Scarab</a> that drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Lightning+Fortification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Lightning Fortification</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantation</a>, and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (8)</a>. Head back up the slope you can from and turn left to find a series of ruins you can run across. If you follow the path, you'll get to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Farum+Azula+Dragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farum Azula Dragon</a> that breathed fire on you earlier on the way to the Dragon Temple. Keep going, and at the end of the path is a ruined structure with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Apostle's+Cookbook+(4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook (4)</a>. Be careful of the two Skeletons that attack you when you pick the item up. In the same area where the dragon is, you'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Fist Alexander</a>. Speak to him and accept his proposal to finish his quest. He'll give you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shard+of+Alexander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shard of Alexander</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Alexander's+Innards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander's Innards</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Dragon Temple Rooftop:</b> When you're done with the area, teleport back to the Dragon Temple Lift Site of Grace. Take the lift down and head back down the stairs to backtrack back to the doorway you took a note of earlier. Continue forward, jumping down the ruins here, where you'll be able to pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragoncrest+Shield+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragoncrest Shield Talisman</a> (+2) hidden within them. Keep following the path and you'll get to an open area where you will meet a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Crucible+Knight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Crucible Knight</a>. Once you defeat it, it will not respawn again. You'll want to head southwest next. There are two viable ways to get to the Site of Grace you see ahead. One is by simply jumping over the banister of the balcony, and the other is by doing a tricky jump onto the floating ruins where you'll find an item. Once you've interacted with the Dragon Temple Rooftop Site of Grace, jump down the roofs and you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (6)</a> next to some <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bladed+Talon+Eagle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eagles</a>. Go down the ladder in front of you and if you look to the left, you'll find a floating platform behind the corner that you can jump to. Follow the path here to get the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Drake+Knight+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake Knight Set</a> and you'll be able to circle back to the Dragon Temple Rooftop Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Path to Maliketh:</b> Head back down the ladder and head south towards the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Farum+Azula+Dragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farum Azula Dragon</a>. On the way, you'll have to fight some more Eagles and avoid the lightning striking down. You can easily tell where it's about to land based on the red areas that appear before the lightning. When you get to the Dragon, you'll find it's at low health. If you're quick enough, you can defeat it before it flees to get a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a>. You'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> in the gazebo behind it. To the left of the gazebo, you'll see platforms down and to the east. If you follow this path, you'll be able to find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Boltdrake+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boltdrake Talisman</a> (+2) & <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Towershield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Towershield</a> and from here, you will eventually circle back to the rooftops. Head back to where the dragon was sitting and head southwest. Go up the slope then turn right, crossing the ruins here going north. You'll find a temple to your right with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somberstone+Miner's+Bell+Bearing+(5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (5)</a> in front of the altar. Be careful in this temple as you will get ambushed by two strong Azula Beastmen. In the south side of the temple, you'll find a path and an elevator taking you to the Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace.<br /><br />
<b>Optional Boss: Dragonlord Placidusax:</b> From here there are multiple options to take. To go and fight <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonlord+Placidusax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonlord Placidusax</a>, head back down the elevator and exit the temple. Head straight ahead towards the edge of the cliff, and if you look down, you'll find some floating platforms you can jump down to. Follow the path down to get to a large empty platform. In the arch on the ground without bones, you'll get prompted to lie down. When you do so, a cutscene will play, after which you'll find yourself in the boss' arena. Defeat Dragonlord Placidusax for the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Dragonlord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Dragonlord</a> and interact with the Site of Grace here after it spawns.<br /><br />
<b>The Great Bridge & Recusant Bernahl:</b> Teleport back to the Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace. Follow the stairs up and you'll get to a large crumbling bridge. For even more loot, head north down the bridge. Head into the building and when you emerge back out, turn left to find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (8)</a>. On the right of the doorway is a ladder you can descend. If you've completed <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Knight+Bernahl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernahl's</a> questline and defeated <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rykard,+Lord+of+Blasphemy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rykard</a>, Recusant Bernahl will invade you when you reach about halfway across the bridge here. Defeat him for a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Blasphemous+Claw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blasphemous Claw</a>, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Devourer's+Scepter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devourer's Scepter</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Champion+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beast Champion Set</a>. In the building ahead, you'll find a chest with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Old+Lord's+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Lord's Talisman</a> guarded by multiple Azula Beastmen.<br /><br />
<b>Boss Fight: Maliketh, the Black Blade:</b> After you're done with that area, teleport back to the Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace and make your way back to the bridge. Head south, going up the bridge this time and you'll encounter a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Draconic+Tree+Sentinel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draconic Tree Sentinel</a>. You can choose to run past this enemy, however defeating it nets you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Malformed+Dragon+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malformed Dragon Set</a>. Continue up the bridge, collecting the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (7)</a>, and head through the fog door. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Defeating the boss ahead causes irreversible changes in the world until NG+. Make sure to finish any outstanding <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC</a> quests and collect any achievement-granting <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Items" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Items</a>, namely in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Royal+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell, Royal Capital</a>, before you do so. You'll start by fighting the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Clergyman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beast Clergyman</a>. If you've given <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gurranq+Beast+Clergyman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gurranq</a> all nine <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deathroot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathroot</a>, his dialogue will be different at the beginning and end of the fight. Once you get him down to 50% health, a cutscene will play and he'll transform into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Maliketh,+the+Black+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maliketh, the Black Blade</a>. On his defeat, you'll be given the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Black+Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of the Black Blade</a> and get teleported back to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Ashen+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell</a>, now in a different state. If you head back to Maliketh's boss area, you can interact with the Maliketh, the Black Blade Site of Grace.<br /><br />

Interact with the Leyndell, Capital of Ash Site of Grace that's nearby. If you return to the Roundtable Hold, you'll notice that things have changed drastically. You can speak to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roderika" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roderika</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Master+Hewg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hewg</a> for new dialogue.<br /><br />

<b>Subterranean Shunning-Grounds:</b> From the Leyndell, Capital of Ash Site of Grace, if you haven't explored the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Subterranean+Shunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranean Shunning-Grounds</a> in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Royal+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell, Royal Capital</a> yet, you can find a sewer hole in the ruined road southwest to access it. You should clear it now before progressing in the Ashen Capital. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Game+Progress+Route#SubterraneanShunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to go to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds section. (Even if you've already cleared this dungeon, you should drop down into it to pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Amber+Medallion+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Amber Medallion +2</a> on the way down.) Once you're done there, teleport back to the Site of Grace and head south to find a corpse with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> on it. In the area, you may also find corpses with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tarnished+Golden+Sunflower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarnished Golden Sunflower</a> and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Sunflower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Sunflower</a> within some of the ruins. Make your way southwest from the Rune Arc to find a set of stairs.<br /><br />
<b>Golden Seed & Somber Stone:</b> To the west, you'll find a ruined part of Leyndell's walls with an illusory tree marking a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Seed</a> (you've probably already grabbed this if you've fully explored Leyndell, Royal Capital). From this illusory tree, head down the stairs directly north and when you emerge back outside, head northwest to find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Valiant+Gargoyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valiant Gargoyle</a>. You'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Ancient+Dragon+Smithing+Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</a> tucked in a corner if you check behind the wall it's standing in front of.<br /><br />
<b>Brother Corhyn & Goldmask's Quest Conclusion:</b> If you're doing the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brother Corhyn</a> questline, head back to the curved staircase and to the right of it, between the stairs and the ruined wall is an ash-covered slope going down. Run across the large tree branch to find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (6)</a> and follow the cliff face east. You'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Goldmask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldmask</a> sitting right up against it not too far ahead, and are able to receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mending+Rune+of+Perfect+Order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mending Rune of Perfect Order</a> from him. If you reload the area, you'll be able to get his armor set, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Goldmask's+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldmask's Set</a>, minus the mask. Corhyn can also be found at the Ashen Capital. Still in the southwestern side of the capital, look for the giant dead dragon. There should be a large spiral spear nearby. Corhyn can be found sitting by it's base. Exhaust his dialogue and reload the area for <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Corhyn's+Robe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corhyn's Robe</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Corhyn's+Bell+Bearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corhyn's Bell Bearing</a>.

Same deal, exhaust his dialogue, reload the area and you'll be able to get the same items.<br /><br />
<b>Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing:</b> Backtrack to the staircase and at the top, take the lift to go up onto a higher level. Here, you'll find <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Gideon+Ofnir,+the+All-Knowing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing</a> who is adamant about stopping you from becoming Elden Lord.

<b>Godfrey, First Elden Lord:</b> Interact with the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace that spawns after Gideon's defeat, and head east out to the main balcony. Turn left and scale the tree root here up and to the west. Follow the path north and you'll get to the Queen's Bedchambers. Here, you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Heal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdtree Heal</a> incantation in the middle of the 'bed'. Continue out the door east and up the stairs you'll encounter a fog door. Beyond this door is <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godfrey,+First+Elden+Lord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godfrey, First Elden Lord</a> in his physical form rather than the golden spectral form you encountered earlier in the game. After taking him down to about 33% health, he turns into <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hoarah+Loux,+Warrior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoarah Loux, Warrior</a> and defeating him nets you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+Hoarah+Loux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remembrance of Hoarah Loux</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Final Bosses: Radagon & Elden Beast:</b> Interact with the Elden Throne Site of Grace that spawned and head up the stairs to the southeast.

Defeat him and the next phase against the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Beast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Beast</a> starts immediately after the transitional cutscene. Defeat them both to be rewarded the <a href="httpsa://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Remembrance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Remembrance</a> and to be able to interact with Fractured Marika, ending this playthrough of the game.<br /><br />

<b>Elden Ring Map: Subterranean Shunning-Grounds Starting Point:</b> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=4580&lat=-101.38125&lng=116.010481&code=mapA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring Map: Subterranean Shunning-Grounds Starting Point</a>. The <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Subterranean+Shunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranean Shunning-Grounds</a> is located underneath the city of Leyndell. The sewers here are maze-like and navigation can get tricky because it doesn't have it's own map. This section will only cover some key items and main NPC interactions to reduce confusion. This area can be done while in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Royal+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell, Royal Capital</a>, however, it's infested with tough monsters and thus recommended to finish later in the game. You won't miss out on any bosses or loot if you visit here later as this area remains untouched. The only thing that changes is how you get to the area. In Leyndell, Royal Capital, you can access the grounds by heading out the door from the Avenue Balcony Site of Grace and jumping down into the well underneath the large dragon wing. At the bottom, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rune+Arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rune Arc</a> and some gates you can open. Follow the path here and open the door at the end to reach a platform overlooking the ground's 'main hallway'. In endgame <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Ashen+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell</a> on the other hand, from the first Site of Grace you encounter, head southwest to find a road with a hole in it. If you jump down from here, you can access a wooden beam with a corpse holding the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Amber+Medallion+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crimson Amber Medallion +2</a> hanging off of it. Jump to the very bottom and you'll end up at the 'main hallway' as well.<br /><br />
<b>The Main Hallway & Pipe Room:</b> This starting area is referred to as the main hallway because many shortcuts in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds all lead back here. Be careful of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ogre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ogres</a> patrolling these halls. Head northeast, and in the first door to your left, you'll find the Underground Roadside Site of Grace. Leave the room and continue northeast, where you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodsoaked+Mask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodsoaked Mask</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodsoaked+Manchettes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodsoaked Manchettes</a> on a corpse. Head back southwest and you'll find a ladder going down in one of the cubbies in the wall. You'll be navigating some pipes here in the next room. There are <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imps</a> waiting to ambush you on the higher ledges that you can target and knock off if you've got any ranged abilities. Follow the pipes up to the southwest then turn left at the corner to get to a large wooden platform with wooden crates and barrels. From here, the pipes take you northwest and it splits into two paths. On the right, the pipe goes down and leads to a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (6)</a>. On the left, there’s a small wooden platform and the pipes lead you to an upper ledge you can jump up to with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (7)</a> and a doorway. Through the doorway, turn right and head up the stairs. The room here has the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shadow+Bait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow Bait</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantation</a>. When you pick it up, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ogre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ogre</a> in the corner gets alerted and will start attacking you. To the northeast, is a gate you can open with the nearby lever, which opens up a shortcut back to the main hallway.<br /><br />
<b>Leyndell Catacombs & Esgar:</b> Head south from here and back down the ladder in the cubby in the left wall. This should take you back to the pipe room with all the Imps. Instead of going up the pipes, look down to the southwest and jump down to the pipe below. You may take a bit of damage jumping down, so make sure you're not too low on health. If you can, it'd be a good idea to kill the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Lobster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Lobster</a> from up here, and when that's done with, jump down onto the floor. Turn left and you'll find another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Lobster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Lobster</a>. In this section of the sewers, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Teardrop+Scarab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teardrop Scarab</a> in one of the hollow pipes that drops a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (7)</a>, and sitting on the far wall is a corpse with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg's+Shackle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohg's Shackle</a> on it. After you've looted these items, head through the hole in the southwestern wall and turn right to find the Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace. Head back up the stairs and turn right. You'll find a lift taking you up. Head into the room and hit the various illusory walls to the right of the stairs to reveal a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lesser+Spirit-Caller+Snail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirit-Caller Snail</a> and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligdrake+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haligdrake Talisman</a> (+1) in a little cubby. Alternatively, you can simply run past the enemies and go straight up the stairs. Run to the very end of the hallway is a lever you can pull. This opens up a shortcut back to the main hallway to your northeast. Now that you've got another shortcut, head back down to the Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace. From here, head down the stairs and turn left. At the end of the hallway will be a flooded room. Head up the stairs and on the corpse ahead is a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort (6)</a>. Head back out the room and into the southwestern hallway. Don't turn right yet but instead, hop onto the circular platform in the room ahead and it'll take you up to a higher floor. In the room here is an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ogre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ogre</a> guarding the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Scale+Talisman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crucible Scale Talisman</a> on the altar further in. Once you've grabbed it, head back down the circular platform and turn left into the hallway we ran past. At the very top of the two staircases, you'll find an Ogre and a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(9)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (9)</a>. Head into the next room and jump down the middle to pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Glovewort+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grave Glovewort (8)</a> from the altar. If you want a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ghost+Glovewort+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Glovewort (8)</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Rune+(11)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Rune (11)</a>, head down the hallway to the northwest and turn left into the room down the stairs. Be careful of the two Ogres hanging out in that room. Backtrack back to the room where you picked up the Grave Glovewort from the altar and head up the stairs to the southeast. Turn right into the next hallway and you may notice that the layout of the area is strikingly similar to the area earlier. Head up the circular platform up ahead and take another right into another hallway. This next area has a couple of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imps</a>. Follow the stairs down and head down the ladder. Continue following the path and in the next room, pull the lever in front of the statue. A message will pop up letting you know a new area has opened. Jump down onto the lower level, then head down the hallway to the northwest. Turning right takes you back up the stairs to the Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace and turning left takes you down to a fog door. Past the fog door is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Esgar,+Priest+of+Blood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esgar, Priest of Blood</a> boss fight, and defeating him nets you the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lord+of+Blood's+Exultation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord of Blood's Exultation</a>.<br /><br />
<b>Dung Eater's Gaol:</b> Teleport back to the Underground Roadside Site of Grace and we'll go pay ol' <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater</a> a visit. If you've received the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sewer-Gaol+Key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sewer-Gaol Key</a> from him, you'll find him here in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds next. Back at the main hallway, head northeast and on the left, you'll see an open sewer grate. Jump down and head northwest. Ignore the opening in the wall on your right for now and head all the way to the end, turning left at the corner. There will be two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Poison+Flower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Poison Flowers</a> here that you can run past, and at the end of the tunnel, there's a ladder you can climb up. Be careful when entering the next room as multiple <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spider+Hand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider Hands</a> will fall from the ceiling. Turn right into the room and the jail cell at the very end houses the Dung Eater. Here, you can tell him that he's free from his jail cell to continue his quest. If you return to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roundtable Hold</a> at this point, you'll find he has left a message for you where has sat. Find and defeat him in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Capital+Outskirts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital Outskirts</a> when he invades to receive the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sword+of+Milos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sword of Milos</a>. Return to the Roundtable Hold to speak to him and listen to his request.<br /><br />
<b>Path to the Forsaken Depths:</b> You can teleport to the Underground Roadside Site of Grace or simply run back past the Giant Poison Flowers from this jail area, but either way you'll want to go back to that opening in the wall you ran past earlier. This is where navigation may get confusing. The tunnels here have numerous splits and turns and are infested by pretty squishy Slugs. To progress forward without worrying about looting, follow this path - from the opening in the wall, the tunnel will naturally turn left. Jump over the gap in the floor and keep going straight. You'll get to a corpse with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Shard</a>. Follow the corner turning right, and the tunnel will slope up. Jump over the gap in the floor again then at the split, turn right through an open gate. Keep going forward from here and the path should naturally turn slightly right and slope down. When you get to the end, you'll know you're at the right place if it opens up to a room with a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(8)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (8)</a> and an <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ogre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ogre</a> guarding a ladder up. Up the ladder, head into the room and immediately turn southwest to open up another shortcut back to the main hallway. At the far east side of this room, you'll see two Ogres sitting idly in front of a statue. Before engaging with them , open the doors directly on the southern wall, directly opposite to the doorway you came from. This narrow doorway will help you deal with them. Pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stone+(7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithing Stone (7)</a> in front of the statue to aggro the Ogres, then run through the southern door. The Ogres won't be able to fit through, letting you run away or deal with them easily. From the doorway, turn left to reach the very top of the broken stairway and look down to find another section of the stairway you can jump down to. There will be a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Teardrop+Scarab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teardrop Scarab</a> here that drops the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stone+(6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somber Smithing Stone (6)</a>. Follow the stairs down, and at the end pick up the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver-Pickled+Fowl+Foot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot</a> before heading into the doorway to your right. Turn left at the corner, then left again at the end of the tunnel. Head down the stairs here, but not the ladder. At the bottom of the stairs, turn completely around to find a little room underneath the platform you were on earlier. You'll have to navigate some narrow tunnels again, but instead of harmless slugs, these tunnels are infested with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basilisks</a>. From the open gateway, turn left at the corpse with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Preserving+Boluses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preserving Boluses</a>, then right where the slope goes up. There'll be a Basilisk up ahead and one in the next cubby to your right. Deal with them then keep going forward in this tunnel. At the very end, turn right, and the tunnels will slope up, leading you to a large room with another <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ogre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ogre</a>. If you loot all the corpses in this room, you'll get four <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glass+Shard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Shards</a>, a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dappled+White+Cured+Meat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dappled White Cured Meat</a>, and two <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Centipede" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Centipedes</a>. Head up the ladder in the room and go through the doorway to the northwest. Open the door across the wooden bridge to open the final shortcut back to the main hallway, this one being directly opposite to the Underground Roadside Site of Grace. Turn around back to the wooden bridge, and hop onto the pipe to the southwest. Follow the pipe up and to the left, being careful of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imps</a>. At the very top, look northeast and jump down to the wooden scaffolding below you. Head through the doorway here but don't head down the ladder. You'll be back in the room with the one Ogre and the multiple corpses with the Glass Shards and Golden Centipedes. Jump down onto the pipe and head into the pipe's opening. Time to navigate some narrow tunnels again! While you run through, you'll find some <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Rat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Rats</a> around. From the pipe opening, the tunnel will naturally turn right. Keep heading forward and the tunnel will naturally turn left. At the turn, immediately turn left again and the tunnels will slope down. Turn right at the split and fall into the hole in the ground. Make sure you're facing northeast and head forward where the tunnels slope down. Turn left at the very end and the path will slope down again. At the end, you'll find a ladder you can climb down.<br /><br />
<b>Mohg, the Omen & The Three Fingers:</b> In the next room, you'll find a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ritual+Pot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ritual Pot</a> on a corpse within a group of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Living+Jar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living Jars</a>. Head northeast and take the cage lift down. At the bottom of the lift, you'll find the Forsaken Depths Site of Grace, and if you follow the path ahead, you'll get to the fog door opening up to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+the+Omen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohg, the Omen</a>. You can use the item that you found earlier, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg's+Shackle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohg's Shackle</a>, to stun him twice during the fight. Defeat him to be rewarded with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodflame+Talons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodflame Talons</a> <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Incantations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incantation</a> and to be able to interact with the Cathedral of the Forsaken Site of Grace. In the chest at the altar is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree's+Favor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdtree's Favor</a> (+1). If you're doing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hyetta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyetta's</a> questline or want to unlock an ending, attack the altar here and you'll open up a secret passage. Follow it and you'll get to a large shaft. You'll be able to jump down safely to two wooden beams. After that, you need to fall the rest of the way down to break the floor. You'll die in the process of breaking the floor, but if you go back and fall through the shaft again, there should be certain areas where you don't die to the fall. At the bottom, you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Frenzied's+Cookbook+(2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frenzied's Cookbook (2)</a> and should be able to finish Hyetta's questline. At the far end of the corridor, you'll find a strange looking pair of double doors. Interacting with the doors while you have all your equipment unequipped triggers a cutscene and gives you access to one of the multiple endings. Go back and speak to Hyetta to get an item. Do note that after going through the door, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Melina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melina</a> will leave you at the next Site of Grace and you will be locked to this ending until you get ahold of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquella's Needle</a>. With all that complete, you're done with the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. Return to the Leyndell, Royal Capital section or to the endgame Leyndell section.<br /><br />

<b>Endings Summary:</b> There are 5 <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/NPCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPCs</a> questlines that lead to different endings - <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brother Corhyn</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater</a>, and though they have no individual questline, the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Three+Fingers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three Fingers</a>. With the exception of the ending granted by the Three Fingers, when you go to interact with Fractured Marika after defeating the Elden Best, you are able to choose which Mending Rune you mend the Elden Ring with, and thus which ending you want to go with. For a detailed explanation of all these endings, visit the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Endings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endings</a> page.<br /><br />
<b>Lord of Frenzied Flame Ending:</b> Interacting with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Three+Fingers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three Fingers</a> in the depths of the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Subterranean+Shunning-Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subterranean Shunning-Grounds</a> will give you access to the "Lord of Frenzied Flame" ending. You'll be given the option to "Become the Lord of Frenzied Flame" when interacting with Fractured Marika. While there are no particular NPC quests tied to this ending, speaking to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shabriri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shabriri</a> prior to receiving the Flame of Frenzy and completing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hyetta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyetta's</a> questline gives you some direction towards and context behind the ending. Do note that receiving the Flame of Frenzy from the Three Fingers locks you out of the other endings (i.e. you cannot get the other five endings even if you have the mending runes for them). To remove the Flame of Frenzy and have access to the other endings, you have to obtain the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Unalloyed+Gold+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unalloyed Gold Needle</a> from defeating <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Commander+O'Neil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commander O'Neil</a>, and bring it to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Gowry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gowry</a> to have him repair it. Defeat <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Malenia,+Blade+of+Miquella" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malenia, Blade of Miquella</a> at <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Haligtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquella's Haligtree</a> and reload the area. There should now be a Scarlet Aeonia (a large red flower that has bloomed) in her boss room. Interact with it to receive <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella's+Needle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miquella's Needle</a>. Next, head to <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crumbling Farum Azula</a> and make your way to the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonlord+Placidusax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonlord Placidusax</a> boss fight. After the cutscene ends, you can immediately use Miquella's Needle in your inventory before fighting the dragon to remove the Flame of Frenzy. It is possible to do all these steps and complete <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Millicent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millicent's</a> questline in the same playthrough. After giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle, follow Millicent's quest until the end. Make sure that you assist her in defeating her invaders rather than betray her, and she'll return the Unalloyed Gold Needle to you.<br /><br />
<b>Age of the Stars Ending:</b> Completing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ranni+the+Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranni's</a> questline and using the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Moon+Ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Moon Ring</a> on her body in the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cathedral+of+Manus+Celes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cathedral of Manus Celes</a> gives you access to the "Age of the Stars" ending. After defeating the Elden Beast, rather than interact with Fractured Marika, interact with Ranni's summon sign found in front of it.<br /><br />
<b>Age of the Duskborn Ending:</b> Completing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fia's</a> questline gives you access to the "Age of the Duskborn" ending. After giving her the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cursemark+of+Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cursemark of Death</a> and defeating <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lichdragon+Fortissax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lichdragon Fortissax</a>, you'll find the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mending+Rune+of+the+Death-Prince" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mending Rune of the Death-Prince</a> on her body. After interacting with Fractured Marika, choose the option to use this Mending Rune to get this ending. It is possible to get this Mending Rune and complete the questline of <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/D's+Twin+Brother" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D's Twin Brother</a> by giving him the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twinned+Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twinned Set</a> after receiving the Mending Rune.<br /><br />
<b>Age of Order Ending:</b> Completing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Brother+Corhyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brother Corhyn</a>/<a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Goldmask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldmask's</a> questline gives you access to the "Age of Order" ending. After reaching the end of their questline and completing <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crumbling Farum Azula</a>, you'll find Goldmask in <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell,+Ashen+Capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leyndell, Ashen Capital</a> and can loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mending+Rune+of+Perfect+Order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mending Rune of Perfect Order</a> from his body. After interacting with Fractured Marika, choose the option to use this Mending Rune to get this ending.<br /><br />
<b>Blessing of Despair Ending:</b> Completing the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dung+Eater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dung Eater's</a> questline gives you access to the "Blessing of Despair" ending. After giving him five <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seedbed+Curse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seedbed Curses</a>, the screen turns black and when the game comes back, you can loot the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mending+Rune+of+the+Fell+Curse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mending Rune of the Fell Curse</a> from his body. After interacting with Fractured Marika, choose the option to use this Mending Rune to get this ending. Do note that using <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Seluvis's+Potion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seluvis's Potion</a> on him instead of the Seedbed Curse locks you out of this ending.<br /><br />
<b>Age of Fracture Ending:</b> If you've beaten the game without completing any of these NPC's questlines or don't want any of their endings, the default ending is the "Age of Fracture". After interacting with Fractured Marika, simply choose the option to "Mend the Elden Ring" to get this ending.<br /><br />
